        <h3>Right to object to the collection of data in special cases; right to object to direct advertising (Art. 21
            GDPR)
        </h3>
        <p>IN THE EVENT THAT DATA ARE PROCESSED ON THE BASIS OF ART. 6 SECT. 1 LIT. E OR F GDPR, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO
            AT
            ANY TIME OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA BASED ON GROUNDS ARISING FROM YOUR UNIQUE SITUATION.
            THIS ALSO APPLIES TO ANY PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. TO DETERMINE THE LEGAL BASIS, ON WHICH ANY
            PROCESSING OF DATA IS BASED, PLEASE CONSULT THIS DATA PROTECTION DECLARATION. IF YOU LOG AN OBJECTION, WE
            WILL
            NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA, UNLESS WE ARE IN A POSITION TO PRESENT COMPELLING PROTECTION
            WORTHY GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING OF YOUR DATA, THAT OUTWEIGH YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OR IF THE

            format. If you should demand the direct transfer of the data to another controller, this will be done only
            if it
            is technically feasible.</p>
        <h3>SSL and/or TLS encryption</h3>
        <p>For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as purchase orders or
            inquiries you submit to us as the website operator, this website uses either an SSL or a TLS encryption
            programme. You can recognise an encrypted connection by checking whether the address line of the browser

        <p>If the SSL or TLS encryption is activated, data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.</p>
        <h3>Information about, rectification and eradication of data</h3>
        <p>Within the scope of the applicable statutory provisions, you have the right to at any time demand information

            concerned. To do so, you may contact us at any time at the address provided in section “Information Required

            Law.” The right to demand restriction of processing applies in the following cases:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>In the event that you should dispute the correctness of your data archived by us, we will usually need
                some
                time to verify this claim. During the time that this investigation is ongoing, you have the right to
                demand
                that we restrict the processing of your personal data.</li>
            <li>If the processing of your personal data was/is conducted in an unlawful manner, you have the option to
                demand the restriction of the processing of your data in lieu of demanding the eradication of this data.
            </li>
            <li>If we do not need your personal data any longer and you need it to exercise, defend or claim legal
                entitlements, you have the right to demand the restriction of the processing of your personal data
                instead
                of its eradication.</li>
            <li>If you have raised an objection pursuant to Art. 21 Sect. 1 GDPR, your rights and our rights will have
                to be
                weighed against each other. As long as it has not been determined whose interests prevail, you have the
                right to demand a restriction of the processing of your personal data.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, these data – with the exception of their
            archiving –
            may be processed only subject to your consent or to claim, exercise or defend legal entitlements or to
            protect
            the rights of other natural persons or legal entities or for important public interest reasons cited by the
            European Union or a member state of the EU.</p>

        <h3>Cookies</h3>
        <p>Our websites and pages use what the industry refers to as “cookies.” Cookies are small text files that do not
            cause any damage to your device. They are either stored temporarily for the duration of a session (session
            cookies) or they are permanently archived on your device (permanent cookies). Session cookies are
            automatically
            deleted once you terminate your visit. Permanent cookies remain archived on your device until you actively
            delete them or they are automatically eradicated by your web browser.</p>
        <p>In some cases it is possible that third party cookies are stored on your device once you enter our site

            party
            (e.g. cookies for the processing of payment services).</p>
        <p>Cookies have a variety of functions. Many cookies are technically essential since certain website functions
            would
            not work in the absence of the cookies (e.g. the shopping cart function or the display of videos). The
            purpose
            of other cookies may be the analysis of user patterns or the display of promotional messages.</p>
        <p>Technically essential cookies (e.g. shopping cart cookies) are archived on the basis of Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. f
            GDPR. We have a legitimate interest in storing these cookies to ensure the technically error-free and
            optimized
            delivery of our services. Other cookies are stored only subject to your consent on the basis of Art. 6 Sect.
            1
            lit. a GDPR. You do have the right to revoke such consent at any time, which will affect all future data
            transactions.</p>
        <p>You have the option to set up your browser in such a manner that you will be notified any time cookies are
            placed
            and to permit the acceptance of cookies only in specific cases. You may also exclude the acceptance of
            cookies
            in certain cases or in general or activate the delete function for the automatic eradication of cookies when
            the
            browser closes. If cookies are deactivated, the functions of this website may be limited.</p>
        <p>In the event that third party cookies are used or if cookies are used for analytical purposes, we will
            separately
            notify you in conjunction with this Data Protection Policy and, if applicable, ask for your consent.</p>

        <h3>YouTube with expanded data protection integration</h3>
        <p>Our website embeds videos of the website YouTube. The website operator is Google Ireland Limited (“Google”),
            Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.</p>
        <p>We use YouTube in the expanded data protection mode. According to YouTube, this mode ensures that YouTube
            does
            not store any information about visitors to this website before they watch the video. Nevertheless, this
            does
            not necessarily mean that the sharing of data with YouTube partners can be ruled out as a result of the
            expanded
            data protection mode. For instance, regardless of whether you are watching a video, YouTube will always
            establish a connection with the Google DoubleClick network.</p>
        <p>As soon as you start to play a YouTube video on this website, a connection to YouTube’s servers will be
            established. As a result, the YouTube server will be notified, which of our pages you have visited. If you
            are
            logged into your YouTube account while you visit our site, you enable YouTube to directly allocate your
            browsing
            patterns to your personal profile. You have the option to prevent this by logging out of your YouTube
            account.
        </p>
        <p>Furthermore, after you have started to play a video, YouTube will be able to place various cookies on your
            device. With the assistance of these cookies, YouTube will be able to obtain information about our website's
            visitors. Among other things, this information will be used to generate video statistics with the aim of
            improving the user friendliness of the site and to prevent attempts to commit fraud. These cookies will stay
            on
            your device until you delete them.</p>
        <p>Under certain circumstances, additional data processing transactions may be triggered after you have started
            to
            play a YouTube video, which are beyond our control.</p>
        <p>The use of YouTube is based on our interest in presenting our online content in an appealing manner. Pursuant
            to
            Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. f GDPR, this is a legitimate interest. If a corresponding agreement has been requested
            (e.g.
            an agreement to the storage of cookies), the processing takes place exclusively on the basis of Art. 6 para.
            1
            lit. a GDPR; the agreement can be revoked at any time.</p>
        <p>For more information on how YouTube handles user data, please consult the YouTube Data Privacy Policy under:
            <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en" target="_blank"

        <h3>Google Web Fonts</h3>
        <p>To ensure that fonts used on this website are uniform, this website uses so-called Web Fonts provided by
            Google.
            When you access a page on our website, your browser will load the required web fonts into your browser cache
            to
            correctly display text and fonts.</p>
        <p>To do this, the browser you use will have to establish a connection with Google’s servers. As a result,
            Google
            will learn that your IP address was used to access this website. The use of Google Web Fonts is based on
            Art. 6
            Sect. 1 lit. f GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in a uniform presentation of the font on
            the
            operator’s website. If a respective declaration of consent has been obtained (e.g. consent to the archiving
            of
            cookies), the data will be processed exclusively on the basis of Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. a DGDPR. Any such
            consent
            may be revoked at any time.</p>
        <p>If your browser should not support Web Fonts, a standard font installed on your computer will be used.</p>
