<br><br><strong>Rapid's API Hub for Enterprise</strong></p>
<p>The Rapid's API Hub for Enterprise is a customizable, next-generation API Hub that can be used by developers across all industries to find, manage, and connect to hundreds of internal APIs as well as external subscription APIs. API Hub for Enterprise integrates seamlessly with internal systems, supports the current APIs used within the Enterprise, works with any API Gateway, and is deployed in a multi-tenant cloud environment. API Hub for Enterprise users can publish their own APIs or discover existing APIs that enable them to innovate faster by sharing services. API Hub for Enterprise also includes a dedicated dashboard that provides valuable insights into API consumption, service level, and other key metrics to facilitate detailed analytics and monitoring of API performance.
<br><br><strong>Rapid's API Hub</strong></p>
<p>Rapid's API Hub is the world’s largest public API hub that enables developers to build, test, publish, and expose their APIs to a broad audience of API consumers who, in turn, use API Hub to discover, evaluate, integration, and manage suitable APIs for inclusion into solutions they are building. We have limited visibility into the type of data traversing an API. However, in the use of the Services, PII such as user name and IDs are captured by our systems. We ensure that all data and information is treated with care. We also ensure that we have a clear reason for processing the data, that the data is held securely and disposed of when the purpose for which the data was originally collected is no longer necessary or the lawful basis for processing the data is no longer valid.
<br><br>In the event that you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact Rapid at 85 2nd St, 4th Floor, San Francisco, CA 94105 or by emailing us at <a href="mailto:privacy@rapidAPI.com">privacy@rapidAPI.com</a>.
