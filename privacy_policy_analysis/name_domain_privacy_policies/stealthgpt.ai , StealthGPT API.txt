                to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply
                with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfill
                our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to

                legal bases to process your personal information: Consent. We

                achieve our legitimate business interests and those interests do
                not outweigh your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms.
                For example, we may process your personal information for some
                of the purposes described in order to: Send users information
                about special offers and discounts on our products and services

                our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law
                enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our
                legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in
                litigation in which we are involved. Vital Interests. We may
                process your information where we believe it is necessary to
                protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third
                party, such as situations involving potential threats to the
                safety of any person. If you are located in Canada, this section
                applies to you. We may process your information if you have
                given us specific permission (i.e. , express consent) to use
                your personal information for a specific purpose, or in
                situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e. , implied
                consent). You can withdraw your consent at any time. Click here
                to learn more. In some exceptional cases, we may be legally
                permitted under applicable law to process your information
                without your consent, including, for example: If collection is
                clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be
                obtained in a timely way For investigations and fraud detection
                and prevention For business transactions provided certain
                conditions are met If it is contained in a witness statement and

                insurance claim For identifying injured, ill, or deceased
                persons and communicating with next of kin If we have reasonable
                grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim
                of financial abuse If it is reasonable to expect collection and
                use with consent would compromise the availability or the
                accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for
                purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a
                contravention of the laws of Canada or a province If disclosure
                is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or
                rules of the court relating to the production of records If it
                was produced by an individual in the course of their employment,
                business, or profession and the collection is consistent with
                the purposes for which the information was produced If the
                collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary
                purposes If the information is publicly available and is
                specified by the regulations WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR

                name, email address, friends list, and profile picture, as well
                as other information you choose to make public on such a social
                media platform. We will use the information we receive only for

                are otherwise made clear to you on the relevant Services. Please
                note that we do not control, and are not responsible for, other
                uses of your personal information by your third-party social
                media provider. We recommend that you review their privacy
                notice to understand how they collect, use, and share your

                necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy
                notice unless otherwise required by law. We will only keep your
                personal information for as long as it is necessary for the
                purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer
                retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax,
                accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this
                notice will require us keeping your personal information for
                longer than three (3) months past the termination of the user’s
                account . When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to
                process your personal information, we will either delete or
                anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for
                example, because your personal information has been stored in
                backup archives), then we will securely store your personal
                information and isolate it from any further processing until
                deletion is possible. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE? In
                Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a
                system of organizational and technical security measures. We
                have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and
                organizational security measures designed to protect the
                security of any personal information we process. However,
                despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information,
                no electronic transmission over the Internet or information
                storage technology can be  to be secure, so we
                cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or
                other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our
                security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your
                information. Although we will do our best to protect your
                personal information, transmission of personal information to

                recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As
                such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any
                other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not
                to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is
                adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you
                about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.
