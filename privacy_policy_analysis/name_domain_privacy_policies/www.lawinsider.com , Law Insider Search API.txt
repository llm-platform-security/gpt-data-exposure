This Privacy Policy (“<b>Policy</b>”) applies to services provided by Law Insider, Inc.

We encourage you to read the details below. This Policy applies to any user or visitor to or user of our Services. We will be the controller of your personal data provided to, or collected by or for, or processed in connection with, our Services.</p><p>We reserve the right to change this Policy at any time. We will notify you of any changes to this Policy by sending notice to the primary email address specified in your account or by a prominent notice on our website. Significant changes will go into effect thirty (30) days following such notification. Non-material changes or clarifications will take effect immediately.

In these cases, we may share your name, contact information and other details you provided when making an account with our partners.</li><li><b>Service Providers:</b> We work with a wide range of third party providers, notably our database administrators, cloud computing services, advertising services, data analysts, application service providers, bulk SMS services, and other non-governmental organizations.</li><li><b>Payment processors:</b>Payment processors: We work with payment processors such as Stripe to help process credit card transactions and other payment methods made through the Services.

In such event, and to the extent legally permitted, we will notify you and, if there are material changes in relation to the processing of your Personal Information, give you an opportunity to consent to such changes.<!-- --> </p><h2>Protection of Company and Others</h2><p>We will also share Personal Information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of Company if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation, or disclosure of your Personal Information is reasonably necessary to detect or protect against fraud or security issues, enforce our terms of use, meet any enforceable government request, defend against legal claims, or protect against harm our legal rights or safety.</p><h4>How Do We Use Tracking Technologies?</h4><p>A &quot;cookie&quot; is a small file placed on your hard drive by some of our web pages. We, or third parties we do business with, may use cookies to help us analyze our web page flow, customize our services, content and advertising, measure promotional effectiveness and promote trust and safety. Cookies are commonly used at most major transactional websites in much the same way we use them in our Services.</p><p>You may delete and block all cookies from our Services, but parts of the Services may not work. We want to be open about our cookie use.</p><p>Even if you are only browsing the Services, certain information (including computer and connection information, browser type and version, operating system and platform details, and the time of accessing the Services) is automatically collected about you. This information will be collected every time you access the Services and it will be used for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy.</p><p>You can reduce the information cookies collected from your device. An easy way of doing this is often to change the settings in your browser. If you do that you should know that (a) your use of the Services may be adversely affected (and possibly entirely prevented), (b) your experience of this and other sites that use cookies to enhance or personalize your experience may be adversely affected, and (c) you may not be presented with advertising that reflects the way that you use our and other sites. You find out how to make these changes to your browser at this site: www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/. Unless you have adjusted your browser settings so that it will refuse cookies, our system will send cookies as soon as access our Services. By using the Services you consent to this, unless you change your browser settings.<!-- --> </p><h2>How Do We Secure Your Personal Information?</h2><p>We take reasonable steps to protect your Personal Information against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, misuse, or destruction. Unfortunately, no data transmission or storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. The safety and security of your Personal Information also depends on you. If you have an account with us, you are responsible for keeping your membership details confidential. Your account is protected by your account password and we urge you to take steps to keep your Personal Information safe by not disclosing your password and by logging out of your account after each use. We further protect your Personal Information from potential security breaches by implementing certain technological security measures including encryption, firewalls and secure socket layer technology. However, these measures do not guarantee that your Personal Information will not be accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed by breach of such firewalls and secure server software. By using the Services, you acknowledge that you understand and agree to assume these risks.</p><p>We retain your personal data while your account is in existence or as needed to provide you Services. This includes data you or others provided to us and data generated or inferred from your use of the Services.<!-- --> </p><h2>Your Choices Regarding Information</h2><p>You have several choices regarding the use of Personal Information on the Services:</p><h4><i>Changing or Deleting Your Personal Data.</i></h4><p>All users may review, update, correct or delete the Personal Information furnished by a user in their user account (including any imported contacts) by contacting us at <a href="mailto:support@lawinsider.com">support@lawinsider.com</a> or by accessing your user account. For your protection, we may only share and update the Personal Information associated with the specific email address that you use to send us your request, and we may need to verify your identity before doing so. We will try to comply with such requests in a reasonably timely manner. If you completely and permanently delete all of your Personal Information, then your user account may become deactivated. If you wish to cancel your account, you may do so through your account page, and any personally identifiable information associated with your account will be deleted as soon as is reasonably practical or as required by applicable law. Please note that we may retain information that is otherwise deleted in anonymized and aggregated form, in archived or backup copies as required pursuant to records retention obligations, or otherwise as required by law.
