Data made available via the MAPD API must be read in conjunction with the provisions in the modern award. If there is an inconsistency between the data and the modern award, the modern award prevails.&nbsp;</p><p>5.3 We do not accept any liability to any person for the information (or the use of such information) made available via the MAPD API.
