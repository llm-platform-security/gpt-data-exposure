In the latter case, personal information you provide to that third party (such as your name, email address, and other information) will be provided to Whimsical through the third party service in accordance with your privacy settings on that third party service. We will use the personal information provided by the third party service to create your Whimsical account. You agree to provide us with complete and accurate information when you register for an account. You will not share your account credentials, or use them in multiple locations at the same time. You must use a unique identity to access and use the Services, and may access the Services only to the extent purchased by you.</p><p>You may attach multiple email addresses to your Whimsical account, including both an Organization Email and a Personal Email. Please be aware that using an Organization Email may affect the ownership of any Content you create on Workspaces using such Organization Email as described in these Terms.</p><p>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and your password, and you are fully responsible for all activities that occur under the account, whether or not you authorized that activity and whether such activities are caused by you or a third party that you permit to access or use the Services. You must immediately notify Whimsical of any unauthorized uses of your account, or any other breaches of security. Whimsical will not be liable for any acts or omissions by you, including any damages of any kind incurred as a result of such acts or omissions.

It is Customer’s sole responsibility to set and manage all Permissions. Accordingly, Whimsical will have no responsibility for managing Permissions and no liability for the Permissions you set. Customer represents and warrants that it is fully responsible for any breach of this Agreement and fully responsible for all payment obligations under this Agreement incurred through its account and/or as a result of any Permissions granted. </p><p>Our Services are not directed to children. Access to and use of our Services is only for those over the age of 16. If you are younger than 16, you may not register for or use our Services. Any person who registers as a User or provides their personal information to our Services represents that they are 16 years of age or older. If we learn we have collected or received personal information from a child under 16 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information. If you believe we might have any information from or about a child under 16, please contact us at<!-- --> <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#0e7e7c67786f6d774e796667637d676d6f62206d6163"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="69191b001f080a10291e0100041a000a0805470a0604">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>. </p><h2><strong>Workspaces</strong></h2><p>Content submitted, posted, created, or modified by Users in the Services is organized into a Workspace. Each Workspace has an Administrator or Administrators who has the right to access, modify, and/or delete Users, Content, and to otherwise exercise control over the Workspace.</p><p>If you have multiple email addresses tied to your Whimsical account, upon creating a new Workspace you will be prompted to choose from which email address the Workspace will be created. This email address will be the initial Administrator for such Workspace. </p><p>There are two general types of Workspaces on the Services:</p><ul><li>“<strong>Personal Workspaces</strong>” that are owned and created by you using your Personal Email. Personal Workspaces can only be accessed by you unless and until you invite other Users and/or change the rights associated with such Workspace by adjusting the Permissions.</li><li>“<strong>Organization Workspaces</strong>” that are owned by an Organization with an eligible subscription and can be accessed by multiple Users or Workspaces created using an Organization Email that are claimed by an Organization as described in “Interacting with Organization Workspaces” and “Content” below. </li></ul><p>If you create Personal Workspaces using your Personal Email, your Personal Workspace is your own and Customer Content created therein is not shared with other Users unless you adjust the Permissions.</p><h2><strong>Interacting with Organization Workspaces</strong></h2><p>If you create Workspaces with an Organization Email, the Organization that provisioned your Organization Email may, subject to the appropriate subscription to the Services, be able to (i) view information about any Workspace you create or for which you are an Administrator; (ii) access a list of Workspace Users and the Content; and (iii) manage your Workspace, including to claim control and ownership of such Workspace and the Content therein.</p><p>If you join an Organization Workspace (whether using your Personal Email or your Organization Email), such Organization Workspace is subject to the Organization’s control and you agree that any Content created in such Organization Workspace will be shared with the Organization and may be accessed, modified, or deleted by the Organization Workspace owner or Administrator. If you join an Organization Workspace, your use must comply with that Organization’s policies and any agreement that you may have with that Organization. Organization Administrators may be able to access, disclose, restrict, or remove Content in or from the Organization Workspace and/or restrict or terminate your access to the Organization Workspace. </p><p>You may convert an existing Personal Workspace into an Organization Workspace by (i) adding Users with an Organization Email as Administrators to such Workspace, or (ii) if such Personal Workspace was created using an Organization Email, failing to change your Organization Email to a Personal Email upon notification from Whimsical that an Organization has claimed such Workspace since it is tied to an Organization Email. If you convert an existing Personal Workspace into an Organization Workspace or transfer or share content with an Organization Workspace, the Administrator(s) of such Organization Workspace may prevent you from later disassociating Content from the Organization Workspace and/or may remove you from such Workspace entirely.</p><p>An Organization may (i) invite you to access and contribute to its Organization Workspace; and/or (ii) invite you to join the Services as a User under its account. As stated in the “Content” section of these Terms, if you submit or post Content to an Organization Workspace, such Content is Organization Content and as between you, Whimsical, and such Organization, the Organization may claim such Organization Content and then own all rights to such Organization Content. For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing does not prevent you from entering into a separate agreement between you and the Organization that addresses ownership of Content as between you and such Organization.</p><p>If you created a Whimsical account on behalf of an Organization, the Organization is the account owner and not you individually. Organizations are authorized to add and remove Users from its Organization Workspaces and its account and modify and re-assign roles on the Organization Workspace (including your role). If the Organization elects to replace you as the Administrator with ultimate authority for the Organization Workspace, you agree to take any actions reasonably requested by us or the Organization to facilitate the transfer of authority to a new Administrator of the Organization.</p><p>If you are accessing an Organization Workspace, you acknowledge that the Services as used by you under such circumstances are a workplace tool intended for use by businesses and organizations and not for consumer purposes. To the maximum extent permitted by law, you hereby acknowledge and agree that consumer laws do not apply in connection with such use of an Organization Workspace and/or your access to the Services through an Organization Email.</p><h2><strong>Content</strong></h2><p>Content made available in a Workspace can be categorized in three ways:</p><ul><li>“<strong>Customer Content</strong>” is Content that you make available in a Personal Workspace through an account using a Personal Email. Customer Content does not include Organization Content or Whimsical Content. </li><li>“<strong>Organization Content</strong>” is any Content posted on an Organization Workspace and any Content posted through an account using an Organization Email. </li><li>“<strong>Whimsical Content</strong>” means text, graphics, images, machine learning models, software, audio, video, works of authorship of any kind, and information or other materials that are posted, generated, provided, or otherwise made available through the Services by Whimsical or its licensors. </li></ul><p><strong>Customer Content Ownership: </strong>We do not claim any ownership rights in your Customer Content. As between you and Whimsical, you retain any and all of your rights to your Customer Content. We consider all Customer Content to be confidential and we do not use, share, or access Customer Content unless directed to do so by you, to ensure compliance with these Terms, and/or to comply with applicable law and other legal requirements. For example, with your permission we would access your Customer Content to respond to and solve your support request. </p><p><strong>Rights in Customer Content</strong>: You are solely responsible for Customer Content and indicate that you own or have the necessary rights to all of Customer Content, and that use of Customer Content does not infringe, misappropriate or violate a third party’s intellectual property rights, or rights of publicity or privacy, or result in the violation of any applicable law or regulation, and that the Customer Content complies with these Terms. By making any Customer Content available through the Services, you hereby grant to Whimsical a non-exclusive, transferable, worldwide, royalty-free license, with the right to sublicense, to use, host, cache, store, reproduce, transmit, publish, distribute and modify (for formatting purposes only), your Customer Content solely in connection with operating and providing the Services and Whimsical Content to you and, depending on the Permissions you grant, to other users, individuals, and/or organizations. Subject to the foregoing license, as between Whimsical and you, you retain any and all of your rights to your Customer Content. </p><p><strong>Organization Content</strong>: Subject to an Organization’s subscription plan, an Organization may claim all Organization Content, which includes any Content you post to an Organization Workspace and any Content you create using an Organization Email. An Organization may claim Organization Content created and/or posted by you by subscribing to the Services at the appropriate subscription level. You will receive prior written notice regarding the claiming of your Content as follows:</p><ul><li>If Organization Content is claimed based on you having posted Content to Workspaces using your Organization Email, you will receive prior notice to your Organization Email.</li><li>If your Content is claimed based on you having contributed to an Organization Workspace using your Personal Email, you will receive prior notice to your Personal Email.</li></ul><p>Upon receiving notice via email, you will have the opportunity to, as applicable, (i) change the email address associated with your account to a Personal Email, (ii) move your Customer Content out of an Organization Workspace, or (iii) copy your Customer Content to a Personal Workspace. If you take no action, your Customer Content will be claimed by the Organization. You acknowledge that if you create Organization Content then as between you and the Organization, if the Organization has the appropriate subscription plan and claims the Organization Content, the Organization will own the rights to any such Organization Content.</p><p><strong>Sharing Customer Content</strong>: You may designate your Customer Content as “public” by setting the Permissions to “public”. If you post your Customer Content publicly, such Customer Content becomes non-confidential and non-proprietary (“<strong>Public Customer Content</strong>”). You agree that Customer Content you designate as public will be accessible by and be available to other Users of the Services to whom you grant access to such Public Customer Content. Consequently, you understand and agree that such Users will have the right to view, comment on, and tag your Public Customer Content. If you grant Users additional Permissions with respect to your Customer Content, you understand and agree that such Users will, depending on the Permissions you grant, have the ability to use, publish, display, modify, or duplicate such Customer Content. You grant Whimsical all rights necessary to make any of your Public Customer Content available to other Users of the Services and to permit those users to engage in the activities described in this section with respect to your Public Customer Content.</p><p><strong>Removal of Customer Content:</strong> You can remove Customer Content by deleting it. However, in certain instances, some of Customer Content may not be completely removed (for example, when your data is shared with someone else, including in an Organization Workspace). We are not responsible or liable for the removal or deletion of any of Customer Content, or the failure to remove or delete such Customer Content.</p><p><strong>Compliance with Laws:</strong> Customer Content must comply with all applicable federal, state, local, and international laws and regulations. Without limiting the foregoing, Customer Content must not, and will not permit any of its Users (including its employees, contractors, affiliates, agents, or personnel) to:</p><ul><li>Contain any material that is defamatory, obscene, indecent, abusive, offensive, harassing, violent, hateful, inflammatory, or otherwise objectionable.</li><li>Promote sexually explicit or pornographic material, violence, or discrimination based on race, sex, religion, nationality, disability, sexual orientation, or age.</li><li>Infringe any patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or other intellectual property or other rights of any other person.</li><li>Violate the legal rights (including the rights of publicity and privacy) of others or contain any material that could give rise to any civil or criminal liability under applicable laws or regulations or that otherwise may be in conflict with these Terms and our<!-- --> <a href="https://whimsical.com/terms/privacy">Privacy Notice</a>.</li><li>Be likely to deceive any person.</li><li>Promote any illegal activity, or advocate, promote, or assist any unlawful act.</li><li>Impersonate any person or misrepresent your identity or affiliation with any person or organization.</li><li>Involve commercial activities or sales, such as contests, sweepstakes, and other sales promotions, barter, or advertising.</li><li>Give the impression that it emanates from or is endorsed by us or any other person or entity, if this is not the case.</li></ul><p><strong>Rights in Whimsical Content:</strong> Subject to your compliance with these Terms, Whimsical grants to you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license, with no right to sublicense, to download, view, copy, display and print the Whimsical Content solely in connection with your permitted use of the Services and solely for your personal and non-commercial purposes.</p><h2><strong>Responsibility of Users</strong></h2><p>Whimsical has not reviewed, and cannot review, all of the Content, including computer software, posted to our Services, and cannot therefore be responsible for that Content, its use or effect.

Accordingly, we assume no liability for any action or inaction regarding transmissions, communications, or content provided by any User or third party. We have no liability or responsibility to anyone for performance or nonperformance of the activities described in this section.</p><h2><strong>Fees, Payment, and Renewal</strong></h2><p><strong>Fees</strong>: Our Services are free with optional paid upgrades (“<strong>Paid Services</strong>”). By using a Paid Service, you agree to pay the specified fees, which we’ll bill or charge you for in regular intervals (such as monthly or annually), on a pre-pay basis until you cancel, which you can do at any time via the workspace subscription settings (<a href="https://whimsical.com/workspace/subscription">https://whimsical.com/workspace/subscription</a>). All fees are exclusive of, and Customer shall pay, all sales, use, excise and other taxes, including VAT, and applicable export and import fees, customs duties and similar charges that may be levied upon you in connection with your use of Paid Services, except for employment taxes and taxes based on Whimsical’s net income. If Whimsical reasonably determines that it is required to collect tax from you in connection with your use of Paid Services, then Whimsical may include the amount of such tax in the charges for which you are billed, and you shall pay such taxes.</p><p><strong>Payment</strong>: If your payment fails or Paid Services are otherwise not paid for on time, we may immediately cancel or revoke your access to the Paid Services. If you contact your bank or credit card company to decline or reverse the charge of fees for Paid Services, we may revoke your access to our Services in general. Whimsical does not accept payment by physical check.</p><p><strong>Automatic Renewal:</strong> To ensure uninterrupted service, our Paid Services are automatically renewed. This means that unless you cancel a Paid Service before the end of the applicable subscription period, it will automatically renew, and you authorize us to invoice you or use any payment mechanism we have on record for you to collect the then-applicable subscription fee (as well as any taxes). Your Paid Services are renewed for the same interval of time. For example, if you purchase a Whimsical.com annual plan, you will be charged each year.</p><p><strong>Refunds:</strong> While you may cancel a Paid Service at any time, refunds are issued in our sole discretion.</p><p><strong>Fee Changes</strong>: We may change our fees at any time. When applicable, we may give you advance notice of the fee changes. If you do not agree with the fee changes, you may cancel your Paid Service.</p><h2><strong>Content Posted on Other Websites</strong></h2><p>We have not reviewed, and cannot review, all of the material, including computer software, made available through the websites and webpages to which Whimsical.com links, and that link to Whimsical.com.
