        <li>
            <b>Fees, Renewal, and Cancellation</b>
            <p>
                <b>Fees for Paid Services:</b> When you utilize a Paid Service, you agree to pay the recurring fees associated with it. These fees will be billed or charged to you at regular monthly intervals, continuing until you decide to cancel. You can cancel at any time through your account settings or by reaching out to our support team.
                <br />
                <b>Payment:</b> In the event of payment failure, non-payment, or late payment, or if we suspect any fraudulent payment activity, we reserve the right to immediately cancel or revoke your access to Paid Services without prior notice.
                <br />
                <b>Automatic Renewal:</b> Recurring Paid Services will renew automatically to ensure uninterrupted service. Unless you cancel your subscription before the end of the current subscription period, it will automatically renew, and you authorize us to collect the applicable monthly fee using any payment method we have on file for you.
                <br />
                <b>Cancellation and Termination by You:</b> To avoid being charged for the upcoming monthâ€™s subscription fee, cancel your subscription before it renews. Immediate cancellation will occur if you cancel before the current paid subscription term expires, and you will not incur further charges.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Refunds</b>
            <p>
                We strive to ensure every customer is satisfied with our service. While we adhere to legal requirements regarding refunds and may have a refund policy in place for our Paid Services, all refund requests will be assessed on an individual basis. The amount of the refund will depend on various factors, such as if you were recently charged for the next billing period but wish to cancel, in which case we will issue a full refund. However, in all other cases, no refunds will be provided, and all payments are considered final. We are here to assist you with any refund-related inquiries.
            </p>
            <p>
                Please read these Terms carefully. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact us at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#44373134342b363004272b342d282b306a3137"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="285b5d5858475a5c684b47584144475c065d5b">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                By using the Invoice plugin, you agree to these Terms of Use, effective from the date stated above.
