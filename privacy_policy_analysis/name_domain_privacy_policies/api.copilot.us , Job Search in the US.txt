                    <p>We may terminate or suspend your account and bar access to Service immediately, without prior notice or liability, under our sole discretion, for any reason whatsoever and without limitation, including but not limited to a breach of Terms.</p>

                    <p>If you wish to terminate your account, you may simply discontinue using Service.</p>

                    <p>All provisions of Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability.</p>

                    <b>14.	Governing Law</b>
                    <p>These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of State of Delaware without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>

                    <p>Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our Service and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might have had between us regarding Service.</p>

                    <b>15.	Changes To Service</b>
                    <p>We reserve the right to withdraw or amend our Service, and any service or material we provide via Service, in our sole discretion without notice. We will not be liable if for any reason all or any part of Service is unavailable at any time or for any period. From time to time, we may restrict access to some parts of Service, or the entire Service, to users, including registered users.</p>

                    <b>16.	Amendments To Terms</b>
                    <p>We may amend Terms at any time by posting the amended terms on this site. It is your responsibility to review these Terms periodically.</p>

                    <p>Your continued use of the Platform following the posting of revised Terms means that you accept and agree to the changes. You are expected to check this page frequently so you are aware of any changes, as they are binding on you.</p>

                    <p>By continuing to access or use our Service after any revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, you are no longer authorized to use Service.</p>

                    <b>17.	Waiver And Severability</b>
                    <p>No waiver by Company of any term or condition set forth in Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any failure of Company to assert a right or provision under Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p>

                    <p>If any provision of Terms is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of Terms will continue in full force and effect.</p>

                    <b>18. Fees, Renewal and Cancelation</b>

                    <p>Fees for Paid Services. By using a Paid Service, you agree to pay the recurring fees. For recurring fees, we’ll bill or charge you in the automatically-renewing monthly interval until you cancel, which you can do at any time by contacting the relevant support team.</p>

                    <p>Payment. If your payment fails, Paid Services are otherwise not paid for or paid for on time (for example, if you contact your bank or credit card company to decline or reverse the charge of fees for Paid Services), or we suspect a payment is fraudulent, we may immediately cancel or revoke your access to Paid Services without notice to you.</p>

                    <p>Automatic Renewal. To ensure uninterrupted service, recurring Paid Services are automatically renewed. This means that unless you notify Tarta.ai before the end of the applicable subscription period that you want to cancel, the subscription will renew automatically. You authorize us to collect the then-applicable monthly fee using any credit card or other payment mechanism we have on record for you. The date for the automatic renewal is based on the date of the original purchase and cannot be changed.</p>

                    <p>Cancellation and Termination by You. Cancellation must be made by you before your subscription renews in order to avoid being charged for the following month’s subscription fee. If you cancel your Account before the end of your current paid-up applicable subscription term, your cancellation will take effect immediately, and you will not be charged again.</p>

                    <b>19. Refunds</b>

                    <p>We want each of our customers to be happy with the service. We may have a refund policy for our Paid Services, and we’ll also provide refunds if required by law.</p>

                    <p>If you feel like you wish to cancel your subscription and get a refund, we will review your case individually, as the sum of the refund depends on many factors. For example, if you were just charged for your next billing period of Tarta.ai service, but you wanted to cancel your subscription, we’ll provide you with a full refund. In all other cases, there are no refunds and all payments are final.</p>

                    <b>20.	Acknowledgement</b>
                    <p>BY USING SERVICE OR OTHER SERVICES PROVIDED BY US, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ THESE TERMS OF SERVICE AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THEM.</p>
