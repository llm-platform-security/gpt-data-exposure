<h4 id="section2">2. COOKIES</h4>
<p>
	We, and third parties with whom we partner, may use cookies, web beacons, tags, scripts, local shared objects such as HTML5 and Flash (sometimes called "flash cookies"), advertising identifiers (including mobile identifiers such as Apple’s IDFA or Google’s Advertising ID) and similar technology ("Cookies") in connection with your use of the Service, third party websites, and mobile applications. Cookies may have unique identifiers, and reside, among other places, on your computer or mobile device, in emails we send to you, and on our web pages. Cookies may transmit information about you and your use of the Service, such as your browser type, search preferences, IP address, data relating to advertisements that have been displayed to you or that you have clicked on, and the date and time of your use. Cookies may be persistent or stored only during an individual session.
</p>
<p>
	The purposes for which we use Cookies in the Service include:
</p>
<table>
	<tr>
		<td>Purpose</td>
		<td>Explanation</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Processes</td>
		<td>Intended to make the Service work in the way you expect. For example, we use a Cookie that tells us whether you have already signed up for an account.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Authentication, Security, and Compliance</td>
		<td>Intended to prevent fraud, protect your data from unauthorized parties, and comply with legal requirements. For example, we use Cookies to determine if you are logged in.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Preferences</td>
		<td>Intended to remember information about how you prefer the Service to behave and look. For example, we use a Cookie that tells us whether you have declined to allow us to send push notifications to your phone.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Notifications</td>
		<td>Intended to allow or prevent notices of information or options that we think could improve your use of the Service. For example, we use a Cookie that stops us from showing you the signup notification if you have already seen it.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Advertising</td>
		<td>Intended to make advertising more relevant to users and more valuable to advertisers. For example, we may use Cookies to serve you interest-based ads, such as ads that are displayed to you based on your visits to other websites, or to tell us if you have recently clicked on an ad. We use Freestar.io and Google AdSense for this purpose.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Analytics</td>
		<td>Intended to help us understand how visitors use the Service. We use Google Analytics for this support.</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>
	You can set some Cookie preferences through your device or browser settings, but doing so may affect the functionality of the Service. The method for disabling Cookies may vary by device and browser, but can usually be found in your device or browser preferences or security settings. For example, iOS and Android devices each have settings which are designed to limit forms of ad tracking. Please note that changing any of these settings does not prevent the display of certain advertisements to you.

<p>Third parties may receive information about you as follows:</p>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Advertisers:</strong> We may allow third parties to use Cookies through the Service to collect the same type of information for the same purposes as we do. In doing so, we adhere to the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising. Third parties may be able to associate the information they collect with other information they have about you from other sources. We do not necessarily have access to or control over the Cookies they use, but you may be able to opt out of some of their practices by visiting the following links: <a target="_blank" href="
http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/">Network Advertising Initiative</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.d1.sc.omtrdc.net/optout.html?omniture=1&popup=1&locale=en_US&second=1&second_has_cookie=0">Omniture</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">Digital Advertising Alliance</a>. Please note that opting out does not prevent the display of all advertisements to you. Additionally, we may share non-personally identifiable information from or about you with third parties, such as location data, advertising identifiers, or a cryptographic hash of a common account identifier (such as an email address) to facilitate the display of targeted advertising. You may be able to limit our sharing of some of this information through your mobile device settings, as described in Section 2 above, or through the Service’s settings.</li>
	<li><strong>Aggregate or Anonymous Information:</strong> We may share user information in the aggregate with third parties, such as content distributors. For example, we may disclose the number of users that have been exposed to, or clicked on, advertisements. </li>
	<li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> We may share information from or about you with our parent companies, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control, in which case we will require them to honor this Privacy Policy. If another company acquires Warcraft Logs, or all or substantially all of our assets, that company will possess the same information, and will assume the rights and obligations with respect to that information as described in this Privacy Policy.</li>
	<li><strong>Investigations and Legal Disclosures:</strong> We may investigate and disclose information from or about you if we have a good faith belief that such investigation or disclosure: (a) is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process and law enforcement instructions and orders, such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, judicial proceeding, or other legal process or law enforcement requests served on us; or (b) is helpful to prevent, investigate, or identify possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service. </li>
	<li><strong>Links:</strong> The Service may link to third party services, like another site’s URL. Except as set forth herein, we do not share your personal information with them, and are not responsible for their privacy practices. We suggest you read the privacy policies on or applicable to all such third party services.</li>
	<li><strong>Third Party Accounts:</strong> If you sign up for, or log into, Warcraft Logs using a third party service (e.g., BattleNet for WoW), we may receive information about you from such third party service. </li>
</ol>
<h4 id="section4">4. CONTROLLING YOUR PERSONAL DATA</h4>
<p>Other users may be able to identify you, or associate you with your account, if you include personal information in the content you post publicly. You can reduce the risk of being personally identified by using the Service pseudonymously, though doing so could detract from the credibility of your contributions to the Service. </p>
<h4 id="section5">5. DATA RETENTION AND ACCOUNT TERMINATION</h4>
<p>You can close your account by email. We will remove certain information from view and/or dissociate them from your account profile, but we may retain information about you for the purposes authorized under this Privacy Policy unless prohibited by law. For example, we may retain information to prevent, investigate, or identify possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service or to comply with legal obligations.</p>
<h4 id="section6">6. CHILDREN</h4>
<p>The Service is intended for general audiences and is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you become aware that a child has provided us with personal information without parental consent, please contact us <a href="mailto:support@warcraftlogs.com">here</a>.

<h4 id="section7">7. SECURITY</h4>
<p>We use various safeguards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or via mobile device, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
