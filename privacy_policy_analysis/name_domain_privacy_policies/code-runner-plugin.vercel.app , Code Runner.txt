      <h1>Terms and Conditions for Code Runner</h1>
      <p>These Terms and Conditions (the “Terms”) govern your use of the Code Runner (the “Plugin”), a plugin that
        allows you to compile and run code in various programming languages.</p>
      <p>By using the Plugin, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the
        Plugin.</p>
    </header>
    <section>
      <h2>License</h2>
      <p>The Plugin is licensed, not sold, to you by the Plugin developer (the “Developer”). The Developer grants you a
        limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the Plugin for your personal, non-commercial
        purposes, subject to these Terms and any other applicable terms and policies.</p>
      <p>You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, rent, lease, sublicense, or otherwise transfer the Plugin or any
        part of it. You may not reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or create derivative works of the Plugin or
        any part of it. You may not remove any proprietary notices or labels on the Plugin. You may not use the Plugin
        for any illegal, harmful, or malicious purposes.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Code Execution</h2>
      <p>The Plugin uses the JDoodle Compiler API (<a href="https://www.jdoodle.com/compiler-api"
          target="_blank">https://www.jdoodle.com/compiler-api</a>) to compile and run your code. The JDoodle Compiler
        API is a third-party service that provides online code execution for various programming languages. The JDoodle
        Compiler API may collect and use your code and other information in accordance with their own terms and
        conditions (<a href="https://www.jdoodle.com/terms" target="_blank">https://www.jdoodle.com/terms</a>) and
        privacy policy (<a href="https://www.jdoodle.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://www.jdoodle.com/privacy</a>).
      </p>
      <p>You are solely responsible for the code that you write, compile, and run using the Plugin. You agree not to
        write, compile, or run any code that is illegal, harmful, malicious, offensive, infringing, or otherwise
        violates any laws, rights, or policies. You agree not to write, compile, or run any code that may damage,
        interfere with, or compromise the Plugin, the JDoodle Compiler API, or any other systems or services. You agree
        not to write, compile, or run any code that may access or disclose any confidential or sensitive information.
      </p>
      <p>You acknowledge and agree that the Developer has no control over or liability for the code that you write,
        compile, and run using the Plugin. You acknowledge and agree that the Developer does not guarantee the
        availability, accuracy, reliability, security, or performance of the JDoodle Compiler API or any other systems
        or services used by the Plugin. You acknowledge and agree that the Developer is not responsible for any loss,
        damage, or harm caused by your use of the Plugin or the JDoodle Compiler API.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
      <p>The Plugin is provided “as is” and “as available”, without any warranties of any kind, express or implied. The
        Developer disclaims all warranties and conditions with respect to the Plugin, including but not limited to
        warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, and title. The Developer does
        not warrant that the Plugin will meet your requirements, be error-free, secure, or uninterrupted, or that any
        defects will be corrected. The Developer does not warrant that the Plugin or the JDoodle Compiler API will be
        compatible with any other systems or services. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied
        warranties, so some of the above exclusions may not apply to you.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Developer shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental,
        consequential, special, exemplary, or punitive damages arising out of or in connection with your use of or
        inability to use the Plugin, including but not limited to damages for loss of profits, data, goodwill,
        reputation, or other intangible losses, even if the Developer has been advised of the possibility of such
        damages. The Plugin is free of charge, so you have not paid any amount for it. Some jurisdictions do not allow
        the limitation or exclusion of liability for certain damages, so some of the above limitations may not apply to
        you.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Indemnification</h2>
      <p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Developer and its affiliates, licensors, partners,
        officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses,
        costs, expenses, and fees (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or in connection with your use
        of or inability to use the Plugin, your violation of these Terms or any applicable laws, rights, or policies,
        your code or any other content that you write, compile, run, or transmit using the Plugin, or any harm caused by
        your code or any other content to any person or property.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Termination</h2>
      <p>The Developer may terminate these Terms and your license to use the Plugin at any time and for any reason, with
        or without notice. You may terminate these Terms and your license to use the Plugin at any time by uninstalling
        and deleting the Plugin from your device. Upon termination of these Terms, your license to use the Plugin will
        automatically cease and you must uninstall and delete the Plugin from your device. The provisions of these Terms
        that by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Changes to These Terms</h2>
      <p>The Developer may update these Terms from time to time. The Developer will notify you of any changes by posting
        the new Terms on this page. You are advised to review these Terms periodically for any changes. Your continued
        use of the Plugin after any changes are posted will constitute your acceptance of the new Terms.</p>
