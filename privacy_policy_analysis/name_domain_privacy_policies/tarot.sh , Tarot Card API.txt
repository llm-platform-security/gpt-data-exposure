  <h2 id="5-data-retention" class="svelte-43e9a">5. Data retention</h2>
  <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary

    an account with us or engage with our Services.
  </p>
  <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal
    information, we will either delete or anonymize it, or, if this is not
    possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in
    backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and
    isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
  </p>
  <h2 id="6-keeping-your-data-safe" class="svelte-43e9a">6. Keeping your data safe</h2>
  <p>We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security
    measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we
    process. However, please also remember that we cannot guarantee that the
    internet itself is 100% secure. Although we will do our best to protect your
    personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our
    Services is at your own risk. You should only access the services within a
    secure environment.

    of age. By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or
    that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such
    minor dependent’s use of the Services. If we learn that personal information

    our records. If you become aware of any data we have collected from children
    under age 18, please contact us at nick@miniware.team.

    request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to
    request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your

    request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.
  </p>
  <p>If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, you
    have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. Please note however
    that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its
    withdrawal.
  </p>
  <p>If you are resident in the European Economic Area and you believe we are
    unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to
    complain to your local data protection supervisory authority. You can find

  </p>
  <h2 id="9-data-breaches" class="svelte-43e9a">9. Data breaches</h2>
  <p>A privacy breach occurs when there is unauthorized access to or collection,
    use, disclosure or disposal of personal information. You will be notified
    about data breaches when Miniware, LLC believes you are likely to be at risk
    of serious harm. For example, a data breach may be likely to result in
    serious financial harm or harm to your mental or physical well-being. In the
    event that Miniware, LLC becomes aware of a security breach which has
    resulted or may result in unauthorized access, use or disclosure of personal
    information Miniware, LLC will promptly investigate the matter and notify
    the applicable Supervisory Authority not later than 72 hours after having
    become aware of it, unless the personal data breach is unlikely to result in
    a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons.
  </p>
  <h2 id="10-do-not-track-features" class="svelte-43e9a">10. Do-not-track features</h2>
  <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications
    include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal
    your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing
    activities monitored and collected. No uniform technology standard for
    recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do
    not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that
    automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a
    standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future,
    we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy
    policy.
