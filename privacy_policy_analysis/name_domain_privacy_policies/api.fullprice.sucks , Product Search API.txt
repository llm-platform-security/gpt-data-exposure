                <h3>Information Sharing</h3>
                <!-- PARAGRAPH -->
                <p>
                  We do not sell, rent, or disclose your personal information to third parties for marketing and advertising purposes without your consent. We limit the disclosure of personal information to what is directly relevant and necessary for specified purposes.

We share your data only with the following parties:

Business partners: We may share your personal information with business partners for providing Services to you.

Google Analytics and Clicky: Our website and mobile application uses Google Analytics and Clicky to analyze user interactions. This is a standard practice for websites to track visitor numbers, popular deals, and trends. We strive not to share personally identifiable information with Google Analytics and Clicky.

MailChimp: If you subscribe to the FullPriceSucks newsletter service, we use MailChimp as a third-party service to manage subscriptions and send emails. MailChimp may obtain non-personal information like email addresses, IP addresses, language preferences, device types, and locations. If you object to this disclosure to MailChimp, you cannot use the service.

Google and Facebook: FullPriceSucks may have third-party login interfaces for FullPriceSucks on Google or Facebook, but we only receive feedback on whether the login is successful, and we do not provide your personal information to these third parties.

Help Scout: If you use the Contact Us feature on the Site to ask for our help, we may share your email address and name with Help Scout to reply to you.

Business Transfers: As our business develops, we may sell or acquire other businesses or services. Customer information is typically one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to pre-existing Privacy Policy commitments (unless the customer consents otherwise). If FullPriceSucks's owner or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will be one of the transferred assets.

Other third parties: We may share personal information with legal and regulatory authorities upon request, outside professional advisors (e.g., accountants, auditors, lawyers) under binding contractual obligations of confidentiality, relevant parties, law enforcement agencies or courts as necessary for legal rights establishment, exercise, or defense, and for prevention, investigation, detection, prosecution of criminal offenses, safeguarding public security, or as required by applicable law.
