            <p class="c2">We are very delighted that you have shown interest in our enterprise. Data protection is of a particularly
    high priority for the management of the Seobility GmbH. The use of the Internet pages of the Seobility GmbH is
    possible without any indication of personal data; however, if a data subject wants to use special enterprise
    services via our website, processing of personal data could become necessary. If the processing of personal data is
    necessary and there is no statutory basis for such processing, we generally obtain consent from the data
    subject.</p>
<p class="c2">The processing of personal data, such as the name, address, e-mail address, or telephone number of a data
    subject shall always be in line with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and in accordance with the
    country-specific data protection regulations applicable to the Seobility GmbH. By means of this data protection
    declaration, our enterprise would like to inform the general public of the nature, scope, and purpose of the
    personal data we collect, use and process. Furthermore, data subjects are informed, by means of this data protection
    declaration, of the rights to which they are entitled.</p>
<p class="c2">As the controller, the Seobility GmbH has implemented numerous technical and organizational measures to
    ensure the most complete protection of personal data processed through this website. However, Internet-based data
    transmissions may in principle have security gaps, so absolute protection may not be guaranteed. For this reason,
    every data subject is free to transfer personal data to us via alternative means, e.g. by telephone.</p>
<h4 class="c9" id="h.grisjwk7nsir">Definitions</h4>
<p class="c2">The data protection declaration of the Seobility GmbH is based on the terms used by the European
    legislator for the adoption of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Our data protection declaration should
    be legible and understandable for the general public, as well as our customers and business partners. To ensure
    this, we would like to first explain the terminology used.</p>
<p class="c2">In this data protection declaration, we use, inter alia, the following terms:</p>
<ul class="c7 lst-kix_sns6hatngh9z-0 start">
    <li class="c6">
        <h4 id="h.if7gknro3nm7" style="display:inline">a) Personal data</h4></li>
    <li class="c5">Personal data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (&ldquo;data
        subject&rdquo;). An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in
        particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online
        identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic,
        cultural or social identity of that natural person.
    </li>
    <li class="c6">
        <h4 id="h.ag3g0p3vko8k" style="display:inline">b) Data subject</h4></li>
    <li class="c5">Data subject is any identified or identifiable natural person, whose personal data is processed by
        the controller responsible for the processing.

    <li class="c5">Processing is any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of
        personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring,
        storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or
        otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction.
    </li>
    <li class="c6">
        <h4 id="h.9m56uw54ybkf" style="display:inline">d) Restriction of processing</h4></li>

        processing in the future.
    </li>
    <li class="c6">
        <h4 id="h.mqu38uwwggck" style="display:inline">e) Profiling</h4></li>
    <li class="c5">Profiling means any form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of personal
        data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict
        aspects concerning that natural person&#39;s performance at work, economic situation, health, personal
        preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or movements.
    </li>
    <li class="c6">
        <h4 id="h.2q5nq6fc64xc" style="display:inline">f) Pseudonymisation</h4></li>
    <li class="c5">Pseudonymisation is the processing of personal data in such a manner that the personal data can no
        longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information, provided that such
        additional information is kept separately and is subject to technical and organisational measures to ensure that
        the personal data are not attributed to an identified or identifiable natural person.
    </li>
    <li class="c6">
        <h4 id="h.hipkw4yjnlee" style="display:inline">g) Controller or controller responsible for the processing</h4>
    </li>
    <li class="c5">Controller or controller responsible for the processing is the natural or legal person, public
        authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the
        processing of personal data; where the purposes and means of such processing are determined by Union or Member
        State law, the controller or the specific criteria for its nomination may be provided for by Union or Member
        State law.
    </li>
    <li class="c6">
        <h4 id="h.g4hvyptc2ssf" style="display:inline">h) Processor</h4></li>
    <li class="c5">Processor is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which processes
        personal data on behalf of the controller.
    </li>
    <li class="c6">
        <h4 id="h.14kxql3gmm0d" style="display:inline">i) Recipient</h4></li>
    <li class="c5">Recipient is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or another body, to which the
        personal data are disclosed, whether a third party or not. However, public authorities which may receive
        personal data in the framework of a particular inquiry in accordance with Union or Member State law shall not be
        regarded as recipients; the processing of those data by those public authorities shall be in compliance with the
        applicable data protection rules according to the purposes of the processing.
    </li>
    <li class="c6">
        <h4 id="h.q08dpfibof1l" style="display:inline">j) Third party</h4></li>
    <li class="c5">Third party is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or body other than the data
        subject, controller, processor and persons who, under the direct authority of the controller or processor, are
        authorised to process personal data.
    </li>
    <li class="c6">
        <h4 id="h.br23514zgyd1" style="display:inline">k) Consent</h4></li>
    <li class="c5">Consent of the data subject is any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the
        data subject&#39;s wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies
        agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her.

<h4 class="c9" id="h.xnkz3njck223">Cookies</h4>
<p class="c2">The Internet pages of the Seobility GmbH use cookies. Cookies are text files that are stored in a computer
    system via an Internet browser.</p>
<p class="c2">Many Internet sites and servers use cookies. Many cookies contain a so-called cookie ID. A cookie ID is a
    unique identifier of the cookie. It consists of a character string through which Internet pages and servers can be
    assigned to the specific Internet browser in which the cookie was stored. This allows visited Internet sites and
    servers to differentiate the individual browser of the dats subject from other Internet browsers that contain other
    cookies. A specific Internet browser can be recognized and identified using the unique cookie ID.</p>
<p class="c2">Through the use of cookies, the Seobility GmbH can provide the users of this website with more
    user-friendly services that would not be possible without the cookie setting.</p>
<p class="c2">By means of a cookie, the information and offers on our website can be optimized with the user in mind.
    Cookies allow us, as previously mentioned, to recognize our website users. The purpose of this recognition is to
    make it easier for users to utilize our website. The website user that uses cookies, e.g. does not have to enter
    access data each time the website is accessed, because this is taken over by the website, and the cookie is thus
    stored on the user&#39;s computer system. Another example is the cookie of a shopping cart in an online shop. The
    online store remembers the articles that a customer has placed in the virtual shopping cart via a cookie.</p>
<p class="c2">The data subject may, at any time, prevent the setting of cookies through our website by means of a
    corresponding setting of the Internet browser used, and may thus permanently deny the setting of cookies.
    Furthermore, already set cookies may be deleted at any time via an Internet browser or other software programs. This
    is possible in all popular Internet browsers. If the data subject deactivates the setting of cookies in the Internet
    browser used, not all functions of our website may be entirely usable.</p>
<h4 class="c9" id="h.psgafisw16yk">Collection of general data and information</h4>
<p class="c2">The website of the Seobility GmbH collects a series of general data and information when a data subject or
    automated system calls up the website. This general data and information are stored in the server log files.
    Collected may be (1) the browser types and versions used, (2) the operating system used by the accessing system, (3)
    the website from which an accessing system reaches our website (so-called referrers), (4) the sub-websites, (5) the
    date and time of access to the Internet site, (6) an Internet protocol address (IP address), (7) the Internet
    service provider of the accessing system, and (8) any other similar data and information that may be used in the
    event of attacks on our information technology systems.</p>
<p class="c2">When using these general data and information, the Seobility GmbH does not draw any conclusions about the
    data subject. Rather, this information is needed to (1) deliver the content of our website correctly, (2) optimize
    the content of our website as well as its advertisement, (3) ensure the long-term viability of our information
    technology systems and website technology, and (4) provide law enforcement authorities with the information
    necessary for criminal prosecution in case of a cyber-attack. Therefore, the Seobility GmbH analyzes anonymously
    collected data and information statistically, with the aim of increasing the data protection and data security of
    our enterprise, and to ensure an optimal level of protection for the personal data we process. The anonymous data of
    the server log files are stored separately from all personal data provided by a data subject.</p>
<h4 class="c9" id="h.umqvzdw5kyba">Registration on our website</h4>
<p class="c2">The data subject has the possibility to register on the website of the controller with the indication of
    personal data. Which personal data are transmitted to the controller is determined by the respective input mask used
    for the registration. The personal data entered by the data subject are collected and stored exclusively for
    internal use by the controller, and for his own purposes. The controller may request transfer to one or more
    processors (e.g. a parcel service) that also uses personal data for an internal purpose which is attributable to the
    controller.</p>
<p class="c2">By registering on the website of the controller, the IP address&mdash;assigned by the Internet service
    provider (ISP) and used by the data subject&mdash;date, and time of the registration are also stored. The storage of
    this data takes place against the background that this is the only way to prevent the misuse of our services, and,
    if necessary, to make it possible to investigate committed offenses. Insofar, the storage of this data is necessary
    to secure the controller. This data is not passed on to third parties unless there is a statutory obligation to pass
    on the data, or if the transfer serves the aim of criminal prosecution.</p>
<p class="c2">The registration of the data subject, with the voluntary indication of personal data, is intended to
    enable the controller to offer the data subject contents or services that may only be offered to registered users
    due to the nature of the matter in question. Registered persons are free to change the personal data specified
    during the registration at any time, or to have them completely deleted from the data stock of the controller.</p>
<p class="c2">The data controller shall, at any time, provide information upon request to each data subject as to what
    personal data are stored about the data subject. In addition, the data controller shall correct or erase personal
    data at the request or indication of the data subject, insofar as there are no statutory storage obligations. The
    entirety of the controller&rsquo;s employees are available to the data subject in this respect as contact
    persons.</p>
<h4 class="c9" id="h.fa4w0bvare3u">Subscription to our newsletters</h4>
<p class="c2">On the website of the Seobility GmbH, users are given the opportunity to subscribe to our enterprise&#39;s
    newsletter. The input mask used for this purpose determines what personal data are transmitted, as well as when the
    newsletter is ordered from the controller.</p>
<p class="c2">The Seobility GmbH informs its customers and business partners regularly by means of a newsletter about
    enterprise offers. The enterprise&#39;s newsletter may only be received by the data subject if (1) the data subject
    has a valid e-mail address and (2) the data subject registers for the newsletter shipping. A confirmation e-mail
    will be sent to the e-mail address registered by a data subject for the first time for newsletter shipping, for
    legal reasons, in the double opt-in procedure. This confirmation e-mail is used to prove whether the owner of the
    e-mail address as the data subject is authorized to receive the newsletter.</p>
<p class="c2">During the registration for the newsletter, we also store the IP address of the computer system assigned
    by the Internet service provider (ISP) and used by the data subject at the time of the registration, as well as the
    date and time of the registration. The collection of this data is necessary in order to understand the (possible)
    misuse of the e-mail address of a data subject at a later date, and it therefore serves the aim of the legal
    protection of the controller.</p>
<p class="c2">The personal data collected as part of a registration for the newsletter will only be used to send our
    newsletter. In addition, subscribers to the newsletter may be informed by e-mail, as long as this is necessary for
    the operation of the newsletter service or a registration in question, as this could be the case in the event of
    modifications to the newsletter offer, or in the event of a change in technical circumstances. There will be no
    transfer of personal data collected by the newsletter service to third parties. The subscription to our newsletter
    may be terminated by the data subject at any time. The consent to the storage of personal data, which the data
    subject has given for shipping the newsletter, may be revoked at any time. For the purpose of revocation of consent,
    a corresponding link is found in each newsletter. It is also possible to unsubscribe from the newsletter at any time
    directly on the website of the controller, or to communicate this to the controller in a different way.</p>
<h4 class="c9" id="h.k1vyozlo4yh7">Newsletter-Tracking</h4>
<p class="c2">The newsletter of the Seobility GmbH contains so-called tracking pixels. A tracking pixel is a miniature
    graphic embedded in such e-mails, which are sent in HTML format to enable log file recording and analysis. This
    allows a statistical analysis of the success or failure of online marketing campaigns. Based on the embedded
    tracking pixel, the Seobility GmbH may see if and when an e-mail was opened by a data subject, and which links in
    the e-mail were called up by data subjects.</p>
<p class="c2">Such personal data collected in the tracking pixels contained in the newsletters are stored and analyzed
    by the controller in order to optimize the shipping of the newsletter, as well as to adapt the content of future
    newsletters even better to the interests of the data subject. These personal data will not be passed on to third
    parties. Data subjects are at any time entitled to revoke the respective separate declaration of consent issued by
    means of the double-opt-in procedure. After a revocation, these personal data will be deleted by the controller. The
    Seobility GmbH automatically regards a withdrawal from the receipt of the newsletter as a revocation.</p>
<h4 class="c9" id="h.3vlaieeeztet">Contact possibility via the website</h4>
<p class="c2">The website of the Seobility GmbH contains information that enables a quick electronic contact to our
    enterprise, as well as direct communication with us, which also includes a general address of the so-called
    electronic mail (e-mail address). If a data subject contacts the controller by e-mail or via a contact form, the
    personal data transmitted by the data subject are automatically stored. Such personal data transmitted on a
    voluntary basis by a data subject to the data controller are stored for the purpose of processing or contacting the
    data subject. There is no transfer of this personal data to third parties.</p>
<h4 class="c9" id="h.v8d9stoz1gw">Comments function in the blog on the website</h4>
<p class="c2">The Seobility GmbH offers users the possibility to leave individual comments on individual blog
    contributions on a blog, which is on the website of the controller. A blog is a web-based, publicly-accessible
    portal, through which one or more people called bloggers or web-bloggers may post articles or write down thoughts in
    so-called blogposts. Blogposts may usually be commented by third parties.</p>
<p class="c2">If a data subject leaves a comment on the blog published on this website, the comments made by the data
    subject are also stored and published, as well as information on the date of the commentary and on the user&#39;s
    (pseudonym) chosen by the data subject. In addition, the IP address assigned by the Internet service provider (ISP)
    to the data subject is also logged. This storage of the IP address takes place for security reasons, and in case the
    data subject violates the rights of third parties, or posts illegal content through a given comment. The storage of
    these personal data is, therefore, in the own interest of the data controller, so that he can exculpate in the event
    of an infringement. This collected personal data will not be passed to third parties, unless such a transfer is
    required by law or serves the aim of the defense of the data controller.</p>
<h4 class="c9" id="h.pxzx3zeaviw7">Subscription to comments in the blog on the website</h4>
<p class="c2">The comments made in the blog of the Seobility GmbH may be subscribed to by third parties. In particular,
    there is the possibility that a commenter subscribes to the comments following his comments on a particular blog
    post.</p>
<p class="c2">If a data subject decides to subscribe to the option, the controller will send an automatic confirmation
    e-mail to check the double opt-in procedure as to whether the owner of the specified e-mail address decided in favor
    of this option. The option to subscribe to comments may be terminated at any time.</p>
<h4 class="c9" id="h.28l0a4ckpm25">Routine erasure and blocking of personal data</h4>
<p class="c2">The data controller shall process and store the personal data of the data subject only for the period
    necessary to achieve the purpose of storage, or as far as this is granted by the European legislator or other
    legislators in laws or regulations to which the controller is subject to.</p>
<p class="c2">If the storage purpose is not applicable, or if a storage period prescribed by the European legislator or
    another competent legislator expires, the personal data are routinely blocked or erased in accordance with legal
    requirements.</p>

<p class="c2">By calling up one of the individual pages of the website, which is operated by the controller, and on
    which an AddThis component has been integrated, the Internet browser of the data subject is automatically prompted
    by the respective AddThis component to download data from the website www.addthis.com. Within the framework of this
    technical procedure, AddThis is informed of the visit and the specific individual page of this website that was used
    by the data subject with the help of information technology. In addition, AddThis is informed about the IP address
    of the computer system assigned by the Internet service provider (ISP) and used by the data subject, the browser
    type and language, the web page accessed before our website, the date and the time of the visit to our website.
    AddThis uses this data to create anonymous user profiles. The data and information transmitted to AddThis in this
    way will enable the enterprise AddThis, as well as affiliates or their partner-enterprises, to contact visitors of

    The cookie saves the computer-based outgoing visits to Internet pages.</p>
<p class="c2">The data subject may, at any time, prevent the setting of cookies through our website by means of a
    corresponding setting of the Internet browser used, and thus permanently deny the setting of cookies. Such a setting
    of the Internet browser used would also prevent AddThis from setting a cookie on the information technology system
    of the data subject. Cookies may also be deleted by AddThis at any time via an Internet browser or other software
    programs.</p>
<p class="c2">The data subject also has the possibility of objecting permanently to the processing of personal data by
    AddThis. For this purpose, the data subject must click on the opt-out button under the link <a

    data subject. If the data subject deletes the cookies from his system, then the data subject must call up the link
    again and set a new opt-out cookie.</p>
<p class="c2">With the setting of the opt-out cookie, however, the possibility exists that the websites of the

<p class="c2">On this website, the controller has integrated components of the enterprise Facebook. Facebook is a social
    network.</p>
<p class="c2">A social network is a place for social meetings on the Internet, an online community, which usually allows
    users to communicate with each other and interact in a virtual space. A social network may serve as a platform for
    the exchange of opinions and experiences, or enable the Internet community to provide personal or business-related
    information. Facebook allows social network users to include the creation of private profiles, upload photos, and
    network through friend requests.</p>
<p class="c2">The operating company of Facebook is Facebook, Inc., 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, CA 94025, United States. If
    a person lives outside of the United States or Canada, the controller is the Facebook Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand Canal
    Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland.</p>
<p class="c2">With each call-up to one of the individual pages of this Internet website, which is operated by the
    controller and into which a Facebook component (Facebook plug-ins) was integrated, the web browser on the
    information technology system of the data subject is automatically prompted to download display of the corresponding
    Facebook component from Facebook through the Facebook component. An overview of all the Facebook Plug-ins may be
    accessed under <a
            href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/</a>.
    During the course of this technical procedure, Facebook is made aware of what specific sub-site of our website was
    visited by the data subject.</p>
<p class="c2">If the data subject is logged in at the same time on Facebook, Facebook detects with every call-up to our
    website by the data subject&mdash;and for the entire duration of their stay on our Internet site&mdash;which
    specific sub-site of our Internet page was visited by the data subject. This information is collected through the
    Facebook component and associated with the respective Facebook account of the data subject. If the data subject
    clicks on one of the Facebook buttons integrated into our website, e.g. the &quot;Like&quot; button, or if the data
    subject submits a comment, then Facebook matches this information with the personal Facebook user account of the
    data subject and stores the personal data.</p>
<p class="c2">Facebook always receives, through the Facebook component, information about a visit to our website by the
    data subject, whenever the data subject is logged in at the same time on Facebook during the time of the call-up to
    our website. This occurs regardless of whether the data subject clicks on the Facebook component or not. If such a
    transmission of information to Facebook is not desirable for the data subject, then he or she may prevent this by
    logging off from their Facebook account before a call-up to our website is made.</p>
<p class="c2">The data protection guideline published by Facebook, which is available at <a
            href="https://facebook.com/about/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://facebook.com/about/privacy/</a>, provides information
    about the collection, processing and use of personal data by Facebook. In addition, it is explained there what
    setting options Facebook offers to protect the privacy of the data subject. In addition, different configuration
    options are made available to allow the elimination of data transmission to Facebook. These applications may be used
    by the data subject to eliminate a data transmission to Facebook.</p>

<h4 class="c9" id="h.mqu6ig1pl5vv">Data protection provisions about the application and use of Google AdSense</h4>
<p class="c2">On this website, the controller has integrated Google AdSense. Google AdSense is an online service which
    allows the placement of advertising on third-party sites. Google AdSense is based on an algorithm that selects
    advertisements displayed on third-party sites to match with the content of the respective third-party site. Google
    AdSense allows an interest-based targeting of the Internet user, which is implemented by means of generating
    individual user profiles.</p>
<p class="c2">The operating company of Google&#39;s AdSense component is Alphabet Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain
    View, CA 94043-1351, United States.</p>
<p class="c2">The purpose of Google&#39;s AdSense component is the integration of advertisements on our website. Google
    AdSense places a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject. The definition of cookies is
    explained above. With the setting of the cookie, Alphabet Inc. is enabled to analyze the use of our website. With
    each call-up to one of the individual pages of this Internet site, which is operated by the controller and into
    which a Google AdSense component is integrated, the Internet browser on the information technology system of the
    data subject will automatically submit data through the Google AdSense component for the purpose of online
    advertising and the settlement of commissions to Alphabet Inc. During the course of this technical procedure, the
    enterprise Alphabet Inc. gains knowledge of personal data, such as the IP address of the data subject, which serves
    Alphabet Inc., inter alia, to understand the origin of visitors and clicks and subsequently create commission
    settlements.</p>
<p class="c2">The data subject may, as stated above, prevent the setting of cookies through our website at any time by
    means of a corresponding adjustment of the web browser used and thus permanently deny the setting of cookies. Such
    an adjustment to the Internet browser used would also prevent Alphabet Inc. from setting a cookie on the information
    technology system of the data subject. Additionally, cookies already in use by Alphabet Inc. may be deleted at any
    time via a web browser or other software programs.</p>
<p class="c2">Furthermore, Google AdSense also uses so-called tracking pixels. A tracking pixel is a miniature graphic
    that is embedded in web pages to enable a log file recording and a log file analysis through which a statistical
    analysis may be performed. Based on the embedded tracking pixels, Alphabet Inc. is able to determine if and when a
    website was opened by a data subject, and which links were clicked on by the data subject. Tracking pixels serve,
    inter alia, to analyze the flow of visitors on a website.</p>
<p class="c2">Through Google AdSense, personal data and information&mdash;which also includes the IP address, and is
    necessary for the collection and accounting of the displayed advertisements&mdash;is transmitted to Alphabet Inc. in
    the United States of America. These personal data will be stored and processed in the United States of America. The
    Alphabet Inc. may disclose the collected personal data through this technical procedure to third parties.</p>

<h4 class="c9" id="h.gv7e0tgja8e3">Data protection provisions about the application and use of Google Analytics (with
    anonymization function)</h4>
<p class="c2">On this website, the controller has integrated the component of Google Analytics (with the anonymizer
    function). Google Analytics is a web analytics service. Web analytics is the collection, gathering, and analysis of
    data about the behavior of visitors to websites. A web analysis service collects, inter alia, data about the website
    from which a person has come (the so-called referrer), which sub-pages were visited, or how often and for what
    duration a sub-page was viewed. Web analytics are mainly used for the optimization of a website and in order to
    carry out a cost-benefit analysis of Internet advertising.</p>
<p class="c2">The operator of the Google Analytics component is Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA
    94043-1351, United States.</p>
<p class="c2">For the web analytics through Google Analytics the controller uses the application &quot;_gat.
    _anonymizeIp&quot;. By means of this application the IP address of the Internet connection of the data subject is
    abridged by Google and anonymised when accessing our websites from a Member State of the European Union or another
    Contracting State to the Agreement on the European Economic Area.</p>
<p class="c2">The purpose of the Google Analytics component is to analyze the traffic on our website. Google uses the
    collected data and information, inter alia, to evaluate the use of our website and to provide online reports, which
    show the activities on our websites, and to provide other services concerning the use of our Internet site for
    us.</p>
<p class="c2">Google Analytics places a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject. The definition
    of cookies is explained above. With the setting of the cookie, Google is enabled to analyze the use of our website.
    With each call-up to one of the individual pages of this Internet site, which is operated by the controller and into
    which a Google Analytics component was integrated, the Internet browser on the information technology system of the
    data subject will automatically submit data through the Google Analytics component for the purpose of online
    advertising and the settlement of commissions to Google. During the course of this technical procedure, the
    enterprise Google gains knowledge of personal information, such as the IP address of the data subject, which serves
    Google, inter alia, to understand the origin of visitors and clicks, and subsequently create commission
    settlements.</p>
<p class="c2">The cookie is used to store personal information, such as the access time, the location from which the
    access was made, and the frequency of visits of our website by the data subject. With each visit to our Internet
    site, such personal data, including the IP address of the Internet access used by the data subject, will be
    transmitted to Google in the United States of America. These personal data are stored by Google in the United States
    of America. Google may pass these personal data collected through the technical procedure to third parties.</p>
<p class="c2">The data subject may, as stated above, prevent the setting of cookies through our website at any time by
    means of a corresponding adjustment of the web browser used and thus permanently deny the setting of cookies. Such
    an adjustment to the Internet browser used would also prevent Google Analytics from setting a cookie on the
    information technology system of the data subject. In addition, cookies already in use by Google Analytics may be
    deleted at any time via a web browser or other software programs.</p>
<p class="c2">In addition, the data subject has the possibility of objecting to a collection of data that are generated
    by Google Analytics, which is related to the use of this website, as well as the processing of this data by Google
    and the chance to preclude any such. For this purpose, the data subject must download a browser add-on under the
    link <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a> and install it.
    This browser add-on tells Google Analytics through a JavaScript, that any data and information about the visits of
    Internet pages may not be transmitted to Google Analytics. The installation of the browser add-ons is considered an
    objection by Google. If the information technology system of the data subject is later deleted, formatted, or newly
    installed, then the data subject must reinstall the browser add-ons to disable Google Analytics. If the browser
    add-on was uninstalled by the data subject or any other person who is attributable to their sphere of competence, or
    is disabled, it is possible to execute the reinstallation or reactivation of the browser add-ons.</p>

<h4 class="c9" id="h.iy848ssifgwg">Data protection provisions about the application and use of Google Remarketing</h4>
<p class="c2">On this website, the controller has integrated Google Remarketing services. Google Remarketing is a
    feature of Google AdWords, which allows an enterprise to display advertising to Internet users who have previously
    resided on the enterprise&#39;s Internet site. The integration of Google Remarketing therefore allows an enterprise
    to create user-based advertising and thus shows relevant advertisements to interested Internet users.</p>
<p class="c2">The operating company of the Google Remarketing services is the Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy,
    Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, United States.</p>
<p class="c2">The purpose of Google Remarketing is the insertion of interest-relevant advertising. Google Remarketing
    allows us to display ads on the Google network or on other websites, which are based on individual needs and matched
    to the interests of Internet users.</p>
<p class="c2">Google Remarketing sets a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject. The definition
    of cookies is explained above. With the setting of the cookie, Google enables a recognition of the visitor of our
    website if he calls up consecutive web pages, which are also a member of the Google advertising network. With each
    call-up to an Internet site on which the service has been integrated by Google Remarketing, the web browser of the
    data subject identifies automatically with Google. During the course of this technical procedure, Google receives
    personal information, such as the IP address or the surfing behaviour of the user, which Google uses, inter alia,
    for the insertion of interest relevant advertising.</p>
<p class="c2">The cookie is used to store personal information, e.g. the Internet pages visited by the data subject.
    Each time we visit our Internet pages, personal data, including the IP address of the Internet access used by the
    data subject, is transmitted to Google in the United States of America. These personal data are stored by Google in
    the United States of America. Google may pass these personal data collected through the technical procedure to third
    parties.</p>
<p class="c2">The data subject may, as stated above, prevent the setting of cookies through our website at any time by

<p class="c2">In addition, the data subject has the possibility of objecting to the interest-based advertising by
    Google. For this purpose, the data subject must call up the link to www.google.de/settings/ads and make the desired
    settings on each Internet browser used by the data subject.</p>

<h4 class="c9" id="h.bo21ngonxakb">Data protection provisions about the application and use of Google-AdWords</h4>
<p class="c2">On this website, the controller has integrated Google AdWords. Google AdWords is a service for Internet
    advertising that allows the advertiser to place ads in Google search engine results and the Google advertising
    network. Google AdWords allows an advertiser to pre-define specific keywords with the help of which an ad on Google&#39;s
    search results only then displayed, when the user utilizes the search engine to retrieve a keyword-relevant search
    result. In the Google Advertising Network, the ads are distributed on relevant web pages using an automatic
    algorithm, taking into account the previously defined keywords.</p>
<p class="c2">The operating company of Google AdWords is Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA
    94043-1351, UNITED STATES.</p>
<p class="c2">The purpose of Google AdWords is the promotion of our website by the inclusion of relevant advertising on
    the websites of third parties and in the search engine results of the search engine Google and an insertion of
    third-party advertising on our website.</p>
<p class="c2">If a data subject reaches our website via a Google ad, a conversion cookie is filed on the information
    technology system of the data subject through Google. The definition of cookies is explained above. A conversion
    cookie loses its validity after 30 days and is not used to identify the data subject. If the cookie has not expired,
    the conversion cookie is used to check whether certain sub-pages, e.g, the shopping cart from an online shop system,
    were called up on our website. Through the conversion cookie, both Google and the controller can understand whether
    a person who reached an AdWords ad on our website generated sales, that is, executed or canceled a sale of
    goods.</p>
<p class="c2">The data and information collected through the use of the conversion cookie is used by Google to create
    visit statistics for our website. These visit statistics are used in order to determine the total number of users
    who have been served through AdWords ads to ascertain the success or failure of each AdWords ad and to optimize our
    AdWords ads in the future. Neither our company nor other Google AdWords advertisers receive information from Google
    that could identify the data subject.</p>
<p class="c2">The conversion cookie stores personal information, e.g. the Internet pages visited by the data subject.
    Each time we visit our Internet pages, personal data, including the IP address of the Internet access used by the
    data subject, is transmitted to Google in the United States of America. These personal data are stored by Google in
    the United States of America. Google may pass these personal data collected through the technical procedure to third
    parties.</p>
<p class="c2">The data subject may, at any time, prevent the setting of cookies by our website, as stated above, by
    means of a corresponding setting of the Internet browser used and thus permanently deny the setting of cookies. Such
    a setting of the Internet browser used would also prevent Google from placing a conversion cookie on the information
    technology system of the data subject. In addition, a cookie set by Google AdWords may be deleted at any time via
    the Internet browser or other software programs.</p>
<p class="c2">The data subject has a possibility of objecting to the interest based advertisement of Google. Therefore,
    the data subject must access from each of the browsers in use the link www.google.de/settings/ads and set the

<h4 class="c9" id="h.yjbzzx301ydg">Data protection provisions about the application and use of LinkedIn</h4>
<p class="c2">The controller has integrated components of the LinkedIn Corporation on this website. LinkedIn is a
    web-based social network that enables users with existing business contacts to connect and to make new business
    contacts. Over 400 million registered people in more than 200 countries use LinkedIn. Thus, LinkedIn is currently
    the largest platform for business contacts and one of the most visited websites in the world.</p>
<p class="c2">The operating company of LinkedIn is LinkedIn Corporation, 2029 Stierlin Court Mountain View, CA 94043,
    UNITED STATES. For privacy matters outside of the UNITED STATES LinkedIn Ireland, Privacy Policy Issues, Wilton
    Plaza, Wilton Place, Dublin 2, Ireland, is responsible.</p>
<p class="c2">With each call-up to one of the individual pages of this Internet site, which is operated by the
    controller and on which a LinkedIn component (LinkedIn plug-in) was integrated, the Internet browser on the
    information technology system of the data subject is automatically prompted to the download of a display of the
    corresponding LinkedIn component of LinkedIn. Further information about the LinkedIn plug-in may be accessed under
    <a href="https://developer.linkedin.com/plugins" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://developer.linkedin.com/plugins</a>. During the course of
    this technical procedure, LinkedIn gains knowledge of what specific sub-page of our website was visited by the data
    subject.</p>
<p class="c2">If the data subject is logged in at the same time on LinkedIn, LinkedIn detects with every call-up to our
    website by the data subject&mdash;and for the entire duration of their stay on our Internet site&mdash;which
    specific sub-page of our Internet page was visited by the data subject. This information is collected through the
    LinkedIn component and associated with the respective LinkedIn account of the data subject. If the data subject
    clicks on one of the LinkedIn buttons integrated on our website, then LinkedIn assigns this information to the
    personal LinkedIn user account of the data subject and stores the personal data.</p>
<p class="c2">LinkedIn receives information via the LinkedIn component that the data subject has visited our website,
    provided that the data subject is logged in at LinkedIn at the time of the call-up to our website. This occurs
    regardless of whether the person clicks on the LinkedIn button or not. If such a transmission of information to
    LinkedIn is not desirable for the data subject, then he or she may prevent this by logging off from their LinkedIn
    account before a call-up to our website is made.</p>
<p class="c2">LinkedIn provides under <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/guest-controls" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/guest-controls</a>
    the possibility to unsubscribe from e-mail messages, SMS messages and targeted ads, as well as the ability to manage
    ad settings. LinkedIn also uses affiliates such as Eire, Google Analytics, BlueKai, DoubleClick, Nielsen, Comscore,
    Eloqua, and Lotame. The setting of such cookies may be denied under <a

<h4 class="c9" id="h.s8gtgbagtk4b">Data protection provisions about the application and use of Twitter</h4>
<p class="c2">On this website, the controller has integrated components of Twitter. Twitter is a multilingual,
    publicly-accessible microblogging service on which users may publish and spread so-called &lsquo;tweets,&rsquo; e.g.
    short messages, which are limited to 280 characters. These short messages are available for everyone, including
    those who are not logged on to Twitter. The tweets are also displayed to so-called followers of the respective user.
    Followers are other Twitter users who follow a user&#39;s tweets. Furthermore, Twitter allows you to address a wide
    audience via hashtags, links or retweets.</p>
<p class="c2">The operating company of Twitter is Twitter, Inc., 1355 Market Street, Suite 900, San Francisco, CA 94103,
    UNITED STATES.</p>
<p class="c2">With each call-up to one of the individual pages of this Internet site, which is operated by the
    controller and on which a Twitter component (Twitter button) was integrated, the Internet browser on the information
    technology system of the data subject is automatically prompted to download a display of the corresponding Twitter
    component of Twitter. Further information about the Twitter buttons is available under <a
            href="https://twitter.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://twitter.com/privacy</a>. During the course of this technical
    procedure, Twitter gains knowledge of what specific sub-page of our website was visited by the data subject. The
    purpose of the integration of the Twitter component is a retransmission of the contents of this website to allow our
    users to introduce this web page to the digital world and increase our visitor numbers.</p>
<p class="c2">If the data subject is logged in at the same time on Twitter, Twitter detects with every call-up to our

    and associated with the respective Twitter account of the data subject. If the data subject clicks on one of the
    Twitter buttons integrated on our website, then Twitter assigns this information to the personal Twitter user
    account of the data subject and stores the personal data.</p>
<p class="c2">Twitter receives information via the Twitter component that the data subject has visited our website,
    provided that the data subject is logged in on Twitter at the time of the call-up to our website. This occurs
    regardless of whether the person clicks on the Twitter component or not. If such a transmission of information to

<h4 class="c9" id="h.1ok7gmstu3ry">Data protection provisions about the application and use of DoubleClick</h4>
<p class="c2">On this website, the controller has integrated components of DoubleClick by Google. DoubleClick is a
    trademark of Google, under which predominantly special online marketing solutions are marketed to advertising
    agencies and publishers.</p>
<p class="c2">The operating company of DoubleClick by Google is Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA
    94043-1351, UNITED STATES.</p>
<p class="c2">DoubleClick by Google transmits data to the DoubleClick server with each impression, clicks, or other
    activity. Each of these data transfers triggers a cookie request to the data subject&#39;s browser. If the browser
    accepts this request, DoubleClick uses a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject. The
    definition of cookies is explained above. The purpose of the cookie is the optimization and display of advertising.
    The cookie is used, inter alia, to display and place user-relevant advertising as well as to create or improve
    reports on advertising campaigns. Furthermore, the cookie serves to avoid multiple display of the same
    advertisement.</p>
<p class="c2">DoubleClick uses a cookie ID that is required to execute the technical process. For example, the cookie ID
    is required to display an advertisement in a browser. DoubleClick may also use the Cookie ID to record which
    advertisements have already been displayed in a browser in order to avoid duplications. It is also possible for
    DoubleClick to track conversions through the cookie ID. For instance, conversions are captured, when a user has
    previously been shown a DoubleClick advertising ad, and he or she subsequently makes a purchase on the advertiser&#39;s
    website using the same Internet browser.</p>
<p class="c2">A cookie from DoubleClick does not contain any personal data. However, a DoubleClick cookie may contain
    additional campaign IDs. A campaign ID is used to identify campaigns that the user has already been in contact
    with.</p>
<p class="c2">With each call-up to one of the individual pages of this website, which is operated by the controller and
    on which a DoubleClick component was integrated, the Internet browser on the information technology system of the
    data subject is automatically prompted by the respective DoubleClick component to send data for the purpose of
    online advertising and billing of commissions to Google. During the course of this technical procedure, Google gains
    knowledge of any data that Google may use to create commission calculations. Google may, inter alia, understand that
    the data subject has clicked on certain links on our website.</p>
<p class="c2">The data subject may, as stated above, prevent the setting of cookies through our website at any time by
    means of a corresponding adjustment of the web browser used and thus permanently deny the setting of cookies. Such
    an adjustment to the Internet browser used would also prevent Google from setting a cookie on the information
    technology system of the data subject. In addition, cookies already in use by Google may be deleted at any time via
    a web browser or other software programs.</p>

<h4 class="c9" id="h.tg0vqdl96vnp">Payment Method: Data protection provisions about the use of PayPal as a payment
    processor</h4>
<p class="c2">On this website, the controller has integrated components of PayPal. PayPal is an online payment service
    provider. Payments are processed via so-called PayPal accounts, which represent virtual private or business
    accounts. PayPal is also able to process virtual payments through credit cards when a user does not have a PayPal
    account. A PayPal account is managed via an e-mail address, which is why there are no classic account numbers.
    PayPal makes it possible to trigger online payments to third parties or to receive payments. PayPal also accepts
    trustee functions and offers buyer protection services.</p>
<p class="c2">The European operating company of PayPal is PayPal (Europe) S.&agrave;.r.l. &amp; Cie. S.C.A., 22-24
    Boulevard Royal, 2449 Luxembourg, Luxembourg.</p>
<p class="c2">If the data subject chooses &quot;PayPal&quot; as the payment option in the online shop during the
    ordering process, we automatically transmit the data of the data subject to PayPal. By selecting this payment
    option, the data subject agrees to the transfer of personal data required for payment processing.</p>
<p class="c2">The personal data transmitted to PayPal is usually first name, last name, address, email address, IP
    address, telephone number, mobile phone number, or other data necessary for payment processing. The processing of
    the purchase contract also requires such personal data, which are in connection with the respective order.</p>
<p class="c2">The transmission of the data is aimed at payment processing and fraud prevention. The controller will
    transfer personal data to PayPal, in particular, if a legitimate interest in the transmission is given. The personal
    data exchanged between PayPal and the controller for the processing of the data will be transmitted by PayPal to
    economic credit agencies. This transmission is intended for identity and creditworthiness checks.</p>
<p class="c2">PayPal will, if necessary, pass on personal data to affiliates and service providers or subcontractors to
    the extent that this is necessary to fulfill contractual obligations or for data to be processed in the order.</p>
<p class="c2">The data subject has the possibility to revoke consent for the handling of personal data at any time from
    PayPal. A revocation shall not have any effect on personal data which must be processed, used or transmitted in
    accordance with (contractual) payment processing.</p>
<p class="c2">The applicable data protection provisions of PayPal may be retrieved under <a

<h4 class="c9" id="h.sjkp633ivk73">SEO Check Widget</h4>
<p class="c2">Seobility provides an image that website operators can integrate into their site to show the current SEO
    rating of the web page. When the image file is called, our server saves a server log file containing the calling IP
    address, date and time as well as the browser signature of the calling web browser. This data will not be evaluated
    and automatically deleted after 7 days.</p>
<h4 class="c9" id="h.xghv18xh27id">Legal basis for the processing</h4>
<p class="c2">Art. 6(1) lit. a GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing operations for which we obtain consent for
    a specific processing purpose. If the processing of personal data is necessary for the performance of a contract to
    which the data subject is party, as is the case, for example, when processing operations are necessary for the
    supply of goods or to provide any other service, the processing is based on Article 6(1) lit. b GDPR. The same
    applies to such processing operations which are necessary for carrying out pre-contractual measures, for example in
    the case of inquiries concerning our products or services. Is our company subject to a legal obligation by which
    processing of personal data is required, such as for the fulfillment of tax obligations, the processing is based on
    Art. 6(1) lit. c GDPR. In rare cases, the processing of personal data may be necessary to protect the vital
    interests of the data subject or of another natural person. This would be the case, for example, if a visitor were
    injured in our company and his name, age, health insurance data or other vital information would have to be passed
    on to a doctor, hospital or other third party. Then the processing would be based on Art. 6(1) lit. d GDPR. Finally,
    processing operations could be based on Article 6(1) lit. f GDPR. This legal basis is used for processing operations
    which are not covered by any of the abovementioned legal grounds, if processing is necessary for the purposes of the
    legitimate interests pursued by our company or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the
    interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data. Such
    processing operations are particularly permissible because they have been specifically mentioned by the European
    legislator. He considered that a legitimate interest could be assumed if the data subject is a client of the
    controller (Recital 47 Sentence 2 GDPR).</p>
<h4 class="c9" id="h.j1c7fiwf2x7e">The legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party</h4>
<p class="c2">Where the processing of personal data is based on Article 6(1) lit. f GDPR our legitimate interest is to
    carry out our business in favor of the well-being of all our employees and the shareholders.</p>

<h4 class="c6">Privacy policy for use and application of Front </h4>
<p class="c2">
    We use Front's service for our support chat and for processing support requests that come via email, phone,
    comments, and ratings. The service is provided by FrontApp, Inc. 525 Brannan St, 300, San Francisco, CA 94107
    <br>
    Email and user data that are submitted during registration are transferred to a Front server in the USA. In the case
    of non-registered users, a pseudonym is automatically generated to identify users in the chat. For both usage types,
    the IP and current URL will be transmitted to help users more effectively. Front uses this information to provide a
    platform for our support that enables us to process customer inquiries. Front does not use the data of our
    recipients to contact them or disclose the data to third parties.
    <br>
    Data processing is based on your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO). Front is an essential part of our offer, an
    opt-out is not possible because parts of our service are no longer usable without Front.
    You will find data privacy information of FrontApp, Inc. here: <a href="https://frontapp.com/privacy-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://frontapp.com/privacy-policy</a>

</p>

<h4 class="c9" id="h.47dspb5e4jdf">Period for which the personal data will be stored</h4>
<p class="c2">The criteria used to determine the period of storage of personal data is the respective statutory
    retention period. After expiration of that period, the corresponding data is routinely deleted, as long as it is no
    longer necessary for the fulfillment of the contract or the initiation of a contract.</p>
<h4 class="c9" id="h.2nttvdzakdgl">Provision of personal data as statutory or contractual requirement; Requirement
    necessary to enter into a contract; Obligation of the data subject to provide the personal data; possible
    consequences of failure to provide such data</h4>
<p class="c2">We clarify that the provision of personal data is partly required by law (e.g. tax regulations) or can
    also result from contractual provisions (e.g. information on the contractual partner). Sometimes it may be necessary
    to conclude a contract that the data subject provides us with personal data, which must subsequently be processed by
    us. The data subject is, for example, obliged to provide us with personal data when our company signs a contract
    with him or her. The non-provision of the personal data would have the consequence that the contract with the data
    subject could not be concluded. Before personal data is provided by the data subject, the data subject must contact
    any employee. The employee clarifies to the data subject whether the provision of the personal data is required by
    law or contract or is necessary for the conclusion of the contract, whether there is an obligation to provide the
    personal data and the consequences of non-provision of the personal data.</p>
