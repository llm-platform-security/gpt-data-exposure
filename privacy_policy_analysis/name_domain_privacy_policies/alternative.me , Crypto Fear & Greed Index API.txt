			</h1>


			<h2 class="title is-4">Foreword</h2>

			<p class="block">First of all, we (alternative.me) take the private nature of your personal information very seriously.

			<p class="block">In the following, we provide some useful information about how we are treating information and using other third-party-integration. Please read this notice very carefully.</p>

			<h3 class="title is-5">Usage Statistics</h3>

			<p class="block">We are using Google Analytics for aggregated statistics about our website visitors. We added a "anonymize-IP" function to the tracking code to make sure no personal data is collected in this process.</p>

			<h3 class="title is-5">Social Media</h3>

			<p class="block">We do embed Facebook and Twitter timelines, as well es YouTube videos, in our website. So be informed that those companies, naming Facebook, Twitter and Google, are using the information that you visited our website. If you want to make it harder for them to track you, you might want to log out of these services when not using them directly.</p>

			<h3 class="title is-5">Cookies</h3>

			<p class="block">Even if the media might give you an other impression, cookies by itself aren't evil. Cookies are not only used to track people all over the internet, but to provide useful services on a website itself. And this is the type of cookies we are using. There is nothing to worry about :)</p>

			<h3 class="title is-5">Ads</h3>

			<p class="block">We may show ads on this page to fund our server cost, but yet, we are not using any third-party ad integration that could leak your privacy to others.</p>

			<h3 class="title is-5">Right to file complaints with regulatory authorities</h3> <p class="block">If there has been a breach of data protection legislation, the person affected may file a complaint with the competent regulatory authorities.

			<h3 class="title is-5">SSL or TLS encryption</h3> <p class="block">This site uses SSL or TLS encryption for security reasons and for the protection of the transmission of confidential content, such as the inquiries you send to us as the site operator.

			<h2 class="title is-4">3. Data collection on our website</h2>
			<h3 class="title is-5">Cookies</h3> <p class="block">Some of our web pages use cookies. Cookies do not harm your computer and do not contain any viruses. Cookies help make our website more user-friendly, efficient, and secure. Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer and saved by your browser.</p> <p class="block">Most of the cookies we use are so-called "session cookies."

These cookies make it possible to recognize your browser when you next visit the site.</p> <p class="block">You can configure your browser to inform you about the use of cookies so that you can decide on a case-by-case basis whether to accept or reject a cookie. Alternatively, your browser can be configured to automatically accept cookies under certain conditions or to always reject them, or to automatically delete cookies when closing your browser. Disabling cookies may limit the functionality of this website.</p> <p class="block">Cookies which are necessary to allow electronic communications or to provide certain functions you wish to use (such as the shopping cart) are stored pursuant to Art. 6 paragraph 1, letter f of DSGVO. The website operator has a legitimate interest in the storage of cookies to ensure an optimized service provided free of technical errors. If other cookies (such as those used to analyze your surfing behavior) are also stored, they will be treated separately in this privacy policy.</p>

			<p class="block"><strong>Storage of the IP address</strong></p> <p class="block">Our comment function stores the IP addresses of those users who post comments.

			<h3 class="title is-5">Google Web Fonts</h3> <p class="block">For uniform representation of fonts, this page uses web fonts provided by Google. When you open a page, your browser loads the required web fonts into your browser cache to display texts and fonts correctly.</p> <p class="block">For this purpose your browser has to establish a direct connection to Google servers. Google thus becomes aware that our web page was accessed via your IP address. The use of Google Web fonts is done in the interest of a uniform and attractive presentation of our website. This constitutes a justified interest pursuant to Art. 6 (1) (f) DSGVO.</p> <p class="block">If your browser does not support web fonts, a standard font is used by your computer.</p> <p class="block">Further information about handling user data, can be found at <a href="https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq" target="_blank">https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq</a> and in Google's privacy policy at <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/" target="_blank">https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/</a>.</p>

This constitutes a justified interest pursuant to Art. 6 (1) (f) DSGVO.</p> <p class="block">Further information about handling user data, can be found in the data protection declaration of Google at <a href="https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy/" target="_blank">https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy/</a>.</p>
