    <h2 class="heading-section">DISPUTE RESOLUTION – MANDATORY ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER</h2>

    <h3>1. Binding Arbitration</h3>
    <p>Except as specifically stated herein, any dispute or claim between you and CarGurus arising out of, or relating in any way to, the Terms and Conditions, the Site, content, or your use of the Site or the Interactive Areas (“Disputes”) shall be resolved exclusively by final, binding arbitration; except that you may bring a qualifying claim over a Dispute in a small claims court in Middlesex County, Massachusetts. By virtue of this Arbitration Agreement (defined below), you and CarGurus is each giving up the right to go to court and have a Dispute heard by a judge or jury (except as otherwise set forth in this “DISPUTE RESOLUTION – MANDATORY ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER” Section). The provisions of this “DISPUTE RESOLUTION – MANDATORY ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER” Section shall constitute your and CarGurus’ written agreement to arbitrate Disputes under the Federal Arbitration Act (“Arbitration Agreement”). Any modification to this Arbitration Agreement, to be effective, must be in writing and signed by you and CarGurus. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and conducted before a single arbitrator pursuant to its rules, including the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes, available at <a href="http://www.adr.org" target="_blank">http://www.adr.org</a> or by calling 800-778-7879. The arbitrator will apply and be bound by this Agreement, apply applicable law and the facts, and issue a reasoned decision or award.</p>
    <p>To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must comply with the limitations provision set forth in subsection 5 below of this DISPUTE RESOLUTION – MANDATORY ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER” Section and submit the Dispute by utilizing the forms available at <a href="http://www.adr.org" target="_blank">http://www.adr.org</a>, and simultaneously sending a copy of the completed form to the following address: Attn: Director of Legal, CarGurus, Inc., 2 Canal Park, Cambridge, MA 02141. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules. The arbitration will be conducted based upon written submissions unless you request and/or the arbitrator determines that a telephone or in-person hearing is necessary. If the arbitrator grants the request or determines an in-person hearing is necessary, the hearing will proceed in Cambridge, Massachusetts, unless the arbitrator determines or we agree that the matter should proceed in the county in which you reside (which county must be in the continental United States of America). </p>

    <h3>2. No Class Action Matters</h3>
    <p>We each agree that we shall bring any Dispute against the other in our respective individual capacities and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, consolidated or representative proceeding or as an association. In addition, we each agree that Disputes shall be arbitrated only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. The arbitrator shall not have the power to vary these provisions.</p>

    <h3>3. Choice of Law and Forum; No Jury Trial</h3>
    <p>If for any reason a Dispute proceeds in court: (a) you agree that any such Dispute may only be instituted in a state or federal court of competent subject matter jurisdiction located in Middlesex County, Massachusetts; (b) you and CarGurus irrevocably consent and submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts for resolution of such Disputes, stipulate to the fairness and convenience of such courts and covenant not to assert any objection to proceeding in such courts; (c) you and CarGurus agree that the Federal Arbitration Act, the AAA rules, applicable federal law and the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, without regard to principles of conflicts of law, will govern this Agreement and any Disputes; and (d) you and CarGurus agree to waive any right to a trial by jury.</p>

    <h3>4. Injunctive Relief</h3>
    <p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, either party may bring suit in court seeking an injunction or other equitable relief arising out of or relating to the infringement of a party’s intellectual property or any conduct that violates the ”Ownership And Intellectual Property” section of the Terms of Use(“Your Conduct”).</p>

    <h3>5. Time Limitations</h3>
    <p>If either of us wants to assert a Dispute against the other, the party with a Dispute must institute arbitration within one (1) year from the date the Dispute arose. Absent commencing the arbitration within one (1) year from the date the Dispute arose, the Dispute(s) will be forever barred.</p>

    <h3>6. Severability</h3>
    <p>If any part of this “DISPUTE RESOLUTION – MANDATORY ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER” Section is ruled to be unenforceable, then the balance of this “DISPUTE RESOLUTION – MANDATORY ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER” Section shall remain in full effect and construed and enforced as if the portion ruled unenforceable were not contained herein.</p>

    <h2 id="8">Storing and Retaining Your Personal Information</h2>
    <p>
        Your personal information is stored on servers in the U.S. Also, some of our
        service providers may store information in servers hosted in countries
        different from where you reside. As such, your personal information may be
        subject to the laws of other countries, where the data protection and other
        laws may not be as comprehensive as your country of residence.
    </p>
    <p>
        Any personal information that we collect is kept as long as necessary to
        fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer
        retention period is required by law or our recordkeeping policies and
        practices. When we no longer have reason to retain your personal information
        and as required by our retention policies, it will be destroyed or
        deidentified in a manner designed to preserve its private and confidential
        nature, however we may retain inactive archival copies.
    </p>
    <h2 id="9">Security - Steps we take to protect your personal information</h2>
    <p>
        We have implemented administrative, technical, personnel, and physical
        security measures designed to help protect the personal information stored in
        our systems against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure or
        modification. We also employ processes (such as password hashing, login
        auditing, and idle session termination, as appropriate) to help protect
        against unauthorized access to your personal information. Technical measures
        that we have implemented also include use of firewall protection and, in
        appropriate instances, encryption technology. Although we take reasonable
        precautions to assess the reliability of such technology, we rely on the
        statements of the vendors of those products and services as part of its
        security evaluation. While we have endeavored to create a secure and reliable
        site for users, the confidentiality of any communication or material
        transmitted to/from the site, and the security of your personal information,
        cannot be guaranteed. We urge you to take every precaution to protect your
        personal information when you are on the Internet.

    <p>
        Nevada law (NRS 603A.340) requires each business to establish a designated
        request address where Nevada consumers may submit requests directing the
        business not to sell certain kinds of personal information that the business
        has collected or will collect about the consumer. A sale under Nevada law is
        the exchange of personal information for monetary consideration by the
        business to a third party for the third party to license or sell the personal
        information to other third parties. If you are a Nevada consumer and wish to
        submit a request relating to our compliance with Nevada law, please contact us
        as at privacy @cargurus.com.

        sharing, and storage of information about you in the U.S. and other

        COPPA. If you are a parent or guardian and you believe we have collected
        information from your child in a manner not permitted by law, contact us at
        privacy @cargurus.com. We will remove the data to the extent required by

        ensure the complete or comprehensive removal of the content and may retain the
        content as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes,
        and enforce our agreements.

    <p>
        We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our
        practices. When we post modifications to this Privacy Policy, we will revise
