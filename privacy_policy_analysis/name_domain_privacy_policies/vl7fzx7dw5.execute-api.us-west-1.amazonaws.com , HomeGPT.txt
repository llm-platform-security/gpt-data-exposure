                <p style="font-weight: 600;" id="chime_real_estate_websites">4.2</p>
                <p>LOFTY REAL ESTATE WEBSITES. Lofty will provide you with the number and type of Lofty Real Estate Websites that is defined in your Subscription Agreement with Lofty. Some Lofty packages do not include access to Lofty website features. Lofty Real Estate Websites include features for marketing to, registering, educating, and providing property information from enabled MLS providers to site visitors and Leads.</p>
                <p>WEBSITE TYPES. Website offerings provided by Lofty fall into the following categories:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Company Website</span>. Full-featured website available only on the Lofty Enterprise package as the top-level website associated with the enterprise account owner’s login.</li>
                        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Team Website</span>. Full-featured website available as the top-level website within the majority of Lofty packages and associated with the team owner’s login.</li>
                        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Group Website</span>. Full-featured website available for add-on purchase only on the Lofty Enterprise package as a group-level website within the Enterprise hierarchy and associated with a group owner’s login.</li>
                        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Agent Website</span>. Full-featured website available for add-on purchase by users who are not the account owners.</li>
                        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Agent Subdomain</span>. A limited-website that requires a source website (“Parent Website”) for listing data and supports only minimal editing capability. This must be a third-level domain (e.g. name.abcrealestate.com) with the Parent Website being the primary domain (e.g. abcrealestate.com).</li>
                    </ol>
                <p>Only one compatible website offering (see the list above) can be associated with a user’s account. This means that no single account can have ownership of more than one Lofty Real Estate Website. Users can be granted admin access to edit websites owned by other users within their organization.</p>
                <p>DOMAIN NAME. When building your real estate website on Lofty, you can choose to use a domain name that you already own or, alternatively, you can choose to select a new domain available or purchased through Lofty. Certain domain options require an additional charge subject to Lofty’s then current fee structure. Lofty reserves the right to refuse the use of any domain name that Lofty determines in its discretion is inappropriate, illegal, offensive, or in violation of another party's rights. When configuring your website on Lofty, your website content may exist only temporarily on a Lofty-specific domain during initial setup stages.</p>
                <p>MLS IDX/VOW DATA INTEGRATIONS. Lofty will make reasonable efforts to integrate your Multiple Listing Service (MLS) IDX and/or VOW data feed(s) from your respective MLS Board(s) as disclosed during the website setup process and/or in writing to Lofty. Any changes to your MLS membership or brokerage must be submitted in writing to Lofty. You will indemnify, defend, and hold Lofty harmless from any failure by you to obtain or maintain the appropriate licenses for the MLS and/or IDX/VOW account to allow use by Lofty on the Website or, for any unauthorized use by you or users on your account of such MLS data or feeds.</p>
                <p>Depending on the MLS(s) connected to your Lofty real estate website, you may be responsible to pay all third-party vendor set-up fees and monthly service fees charged by the MLS/IDX/VOW provider for Lofty to access and maintain MLS data on your Lofty website.</p>
                <p>You shall also pay directly all charges from the MLS data provider including costs associated with MLS integration, and other marketing costs associated with the service. In certain geographic areas, Lofty may, at its option, configure multiple unique MLS feeds into a single platform. Multiple MLS feeds are subject to additional charges as determined by Lofty. Lofty will not be liable in the event that the MLS application process is unsuccessful or exceeds the initial timeline established by Lofty.</p>
                <p>Lofty will not be liable in the event that the MLS application process is unsuccessful or exceeds the initial timeline established by Lofty.</p>
                <p>MANUAL LISTINGS. Certain configurations of Lofty Real Estate Websites support the ability to upload manual listings that are not provided by an MLS/IDX/VOW provider (“Manual Listings”). These can sometimes be referred to as “pocket listings.” You are advised to consult your legal resources prior to publishing Manual Listings to your Lofty Real Estate Website to ensure that doing so does not conflict with your obligations with any memberships, associations, or legal entities that may prohibit their use. Lofty will not be held liable for you publishing Manual Listings that are not permitted in any scenario.</p>
                <p>THIRD-PARTY DATA. In certain configurations within the Services, Lofty Real Estate Websites display data for a geographic location designated in comprehensive plans, ordinances, or other local documents, commonly referred to as a neighborhood (collectively, a “Neighborhood,” or “Neighborhoods”). You acknowledge Neighborhoods are not subject to a generally accepted definition, but are subject to individual interpretation. Also, Neighborhoods as shown on the Member Website are not necessarily "subdivisions" and Neighborhoods are not available for every city in the U.S. You may find deviations between what is shown and what you might personally expect. Neighborhood data may also be unavailable outside of the United States.</p>
                <p>You also acknowledge that data availability for certain aspects of pages on your Lofty Real Estate Website may vary depending on what is available from the third-party data source. Examples may include statistical data, pre-populated geographic descriptions and overviews, school data, and multiple other aspects of Lofty Real Estate Website webpages. This data is provided via third-party agreements and datasets and as such, the availability in some scenarios (location, dates, etc.) will vary.</p>
                <p>BRANDING AND CONTENT. You warrant that all Branding and Content that you provide and/or implement on your Lofty real estate website will comply with all MLS rules and regulations and all applicable laws.</p>
                <p>WEBSITE CUSTOMIZATIONS. As part of the Services, Lofty provides a custom-built Content Management System (“CMS”) for the configuring of Lofty real estate websites. Certain features allow for authorized users to add custom code to their Real Estate Website for the purpose of tracking, linking to other web services, or changing the visible design. You accept any risks related to the presentation, availability, or functionality of your real estate website associated with the addition of any custom code by you or any third party who you have authorized to do so on your behalf.</p>
                <p>If, upon your approval, Lofty has added custom code to your website, you accept that any configurations made are done without warranty and can be affected by changes made via the CMS at a later point and may require adjusting. New product releases published by Lofty within the Services and related to your website may affect customizations that you have implemented.</p>
                <p style="font-weight: 600;">4.3</p>
                <p>WEB, MOBILE, AND TABLET APPS. Lofty Services can be accessed via desktop or laptop computers using the Lofty Web App (using a supported browser) or via mobile phone or tablet devices using multiple native mobile and tablet apps available to download on Android and Apple app stores (collectively, “Supported Devices”). You acknowledge and understand that features available to utilize Lofty Services will vary between Supported Devices and that not all features available on one device will always be available on another (e.g. tablet vs. cell phone phones).</p>
                <p style="font-weight: 600;">4.4</p>
                <p>LOFTY LENDER CRM. The Lofty Lender CRM (“Lender CRM”) is a version of Lofty’s Services configured for the use by a mortgage lender as the intended user. Lender CRM access can be established via the Platform but is not available to all packages. You understand that The Lender CRM is not the same as the Lofty CRM and therefore there will be functionality differences between them.</p>
                <p style="font-weight: 600;">4.5</p>
                <p>LOCATION. You accept that there may be limitations to functionality within provided Services due to unavailable data or support for specific locations.</p>
                <p style="font-weight: 600;">4.6</p>
                <p>UPDATES AND EARLY ACCESS. Lofty reserves the right to update, modify, and upgrade the Platform and Services in its sole discretion during the term of this Agreement. Such modifications or updates may include new or modified functionality or removal of functions.</p>
                <p>We may make certain features available to some users before they are published to all users (“Early Access Features”, “Beta Features”, “Whitelist Features”).

                                        <li>When utilizing Listing Promotion Ads directly to market your real estate listings or Boost Ads via the Lofty Platform on Facebook and related services, you must ensure that any images, videos, and/or other content for these ads are related to real estate and appropriate for all appropriate audiences. If the images, videos, and/or other content that you upload are considered to be related to alcohol, adult content, and or anything not firmly considered to be part of the real estate/housing category, they may be removed. Lofty reserves the right to (but is not responsible for) editing any posts that may not utilize images, video, and/or other content not appropriate to the platform providers’ terms for the real estate/housing category.</li>
                                        <li>If you promote the product(s) with the incorrect category that Facebook Ads Platforms disapproved for Housing, your ads might be edited or deleted by Lofty without your permission and you will not be issued a refund.</li>
                                        <li>It is your responsibility to ensure that you have the necessary permission to promote or create marketing material with listings from your MLS/VOW/IDX.

                                    <p>Marketing Billing</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>AD BUDGET AND MANAGEMENT FEES. You will provide a monetary advertising budget ("Ad Budget"), and hereby appoint and authorize Lofty as an agent to procure advertising on your behalf utilizing this Ad Budget. In addition to the Ad Budget, you will pay Lofty a management fee (“Management Fee”) to be determined by Lofty based upon the type of marketing service and Ad Budget. Lofty reserves the right to raise or lower the Management Fee at any time. Lofty will notify you of such a change which will go into affect as of the next billing cycle. Minimum Ad Budget amounts may be required in order to run different types of Lead Generation campaigns and these amounts are subject to change at any time at the discretion of Lofty. The Management Fee and Ad Budget are both non-transferable and non-refundable.</li>
                                        <li>MARKETING SERVICES RENEWAL. Lofty renews your order on the first day of each month (“Billing Cycle”), and charges you the Ad Budget and the Management Fee. You may change, pause, or cancel the order before the next Billing Cycle by notifying Lofty Support or your Lofty Digital Marketing Analyst at least seven (7) business days prior to the next Billing Cycle. Otherwise, Lofty will continue to use the same settings to operate and optimize your advertising without further notice.</li>
                                        <li>PRORATION. In certain scenarios, Lofty will process your Billing Cycle using a prorated billing method for the initial bill if starting a campaign in a month that has already begun. This is calculated by taking the total monthly Ad Budget, dividing it by the total days in the current month, and then multiplying this by the number of days remaining in the current month (“Proration”). By prorating, this will allow for a similar daily amount to be billed (and therefore utilized for advertising) within the current month Billing Cycle and future month Billing Cycles. Future billing will resume on the first of every month at the full amount and will not be prorated. The Management Fee will not be prorated and will always be billed at the amount defined in this Agreement.</li>
                                        <li>ADS OPERATING DURATION. For Lead Generation ads, Lofty offers ongoing subscription plans. If you require a specific plan duration, you may contact your Digital Marketing Analyst for professional advice and to discuss the details or the duration. Lofty will continue your subscription until you request a change or to cancel, unless otherwise specified. When you successfully subscribe to Lead Generation Ads, Lofty will assume that you are aware of and accept the duration of ads as defined herein.</li>
                                        <li>CANCELLATION AND REFUNDS. When you request that your Lofty Marketing Services to be canceled, Lofty will not refund the remaining account budget nor stop your ads. Instead, the Ad Budget will be utilized to continue to run your ads until it is depleted. If the ad spending exceeds the budget subsequent to cancellation, you will not be responsible for paying any overspending cost or the Management Fee related specifically to what was overspent.</li>

                                <li>Free Trial. On certain occasions, Lofty will offer the AI Assistant to be available to users on a free trial basis. The duration of the free trial will be specified upon initiating its functionality for your account. Your continued use of the AI Assistant upon completion of the free trial indicates your approval to process recurring billing for the following billing dates.</li>
                                <li>The AI Assistant will be available in different packages (“AI Packages”) whose functionality will vary depending on the option selected and purchased.</li>

                                    <p>There are two billing scenarios currently supported via the platform:</p>

                                        <li>Certain AI Assistant legacy package billing (not available for new purchases) for the AI Assistant is processed based on the number of engagements (“AI Engagements”) that have been processed. Each AI Assistant package defines a maximum number of AI Engagements that are allowed during that month. Overages to the allocated number of AI Engagements within a monthly period will result in additional charges whose cost varies depending on the AI Assistant package purchased. All charges will be billed in the next calendar month following the month that the Service was provided including the overage fees.</li>
                                        <li>All ongoing AI Assistant packages purchased will have billing processed based on the number of leads being followed (“AI Following”) by the AI Assistant. Each AI Assistant package specifies a maximum number of AI Following allowed during that month. Overages to the allocated number of AI Following within a monthly period will result in additional charges whose cost varies depending on the AI Assistant package purchased. All charges will be billed in the calendar month following the month that the Service was provided including the overage fees.</li>

                                <li>There are multiple call packages and text packages that can be licensed within the Lofty platform or Lofty Marketplace. Certain call or text features are only available on specific call or text packages. According to these packages, you will be billed based on call duration and the number of texts sent out in your package.</li>
                                <li>Account owners, designated account admins, and individual team members can select call or text packages. Within the platform, users can see a monthly report of the total number of calls made and texts sent via the CRM. If you require a full statement showing all available details for calls and texts made, or you would like to upgrade or cancel your call or text package, please contact the Lofty Support Team (<a href="mailto:support@lofty.com">support@lofty.com</a>).</li>
                                <li>To use a call or text package on the Lofty platform, a virtual number is required. These virtual numbers are available as part of available platform or call/text packages. A virtual number can be allocated for personal use (“Personal Virtual Number”) or for shared account use (“Company Virtual Number”). The purchase of a virtual number may require payment of an additional monthly fee.</li>
                                <li>If you have a phone number (currently hosted at another provider) that you would like to use within the Lofty platform with your call and text packages, please contact the Lofty Support Team to discuss the process. Lofty does not guarantee the ability to port in/out numbers to or from the platform nor does Lofty guarantee doing so within a specific timeline though reasonable efforts will be made to do so.</li>
                                <li>Of the available Lofty call or text packages, each package has an established limit for the number of phone call minutes or text messages that can be processed via that virtual number and account. In most scenarios, these limitations are in place to protect the validity of the virtual number in use and reduce the likelihood that the number will be flagged as "fraudulent," "spam," "scam likely," etc., or be blocked by phone carriers. Users who are using a call package labeled as "unlimited" minutes or allow for overages will accept responsibility for any resulting damage caused by casual use. Any unlimited text package should be used with caution as each additional text message above the established limit (outlined in package pricing and features) will be an additional cost at your expense.</li>
                                <li>Call and Text Vendors. Lofty, through its call/text vendors (“Call/Text Vendors”), transmits and receives text messages and voice broadcasts via other major telecommunications companies and mobile network operators, and thus our influence over the timing of the transmission of your messages and broadcasts is within the technical constraints imposed upon us. While we shall use commercially reasonable efforts to transmit your messages and broadcasts to the applicable network for final delivery to your designated recipients as fast as possible, we cannot commit to, and do not guarantee, a specific delivery time. Such times depend on various network and system-related factors among the various entities involved in the transportation of your messages and broadcasts across the public switched telephone network and/or Internet. You should know that communications carriers assign text messages and voice broadcasts with a default lifetime and any message or broadcast that cannot be delivered successfully within the lifetime assigned to it will be discarded by the communications carrier without any notice. We are not liable for any loss incurred by the failure of a message or broadcast to be delivered, and you acknowledge that damages for financial or other loss resulting from delivery failure cannot be claimed from us for any such non-deliveries. Furthermore, you agree that message and broadcast contents are deemed to have zero value. Lofty and our Call/Text Vendors only provide that the Service is processed correctly and further transmitted by the Call/Text Vendors to the applicable network. Lofty is not responsible for the final delivery of any communication initiated through the Service, as this is out of our control and is the responsibility of downstream communications carriers.</li>
                                <li>In the case that the Service is suspected of being misused by you, including for fraudulent activity, Lofty reserves the right at its sole discretion to immediately terminate the Service and inform our Call/Text Vendors, any relevant law enforcement agency, and the public that the Service is believed to have been used for inappropriate business. In addition, Lofty reserves the right to terminate your use of the Service, with or without cause and with or without specifying any reason for termination, upon at least thirty (30) days' notice of termination to you.

                <p>The use of certain Services may be subject to payment of particular fees, as determined by us in our sole discretion ("Fees"). We will provide notice of such Fees then in effect in relation to such Services prior to charging any amount to your payment method on file. If you wish to receive or use such Services, you are required to pay all applicable Fees in advance or, as required by specific Services, in arrears. We reserve the right to change our Fees at any time, upon notice to you if such change may affect your existing subscriptions, except where a term agreement has been made between you and Lofty.</p>
                <p style="font-weight: 600;">6.1</p>
                <p>CURRENCY. All Fees are in U.S. Dollars, except as specifically stated otherwise in writing by us. All Fees shall be paid in U.S. Dollars.</p>
                <p style="font-weight: 600;">6.2</p>
                <p>TAXES. To the extent permitted by law (and unless specified otherwise by us in writing), all Fees are exclusive of all taxes (including value added tax, sales tax, goods and services tax, etc.), levies or duties imposed by taxing authorities ("Taxes"), and you shall be responsible for payment of all applicable Taxes relating to your use of the Services, or to any payments or purchases made by you. If we are obligated to collect or pay Taxes for the Fees payable by you, and whether or not such Taxes were added and collected from you for previous transactions, such Taxes may be added to the payment of any outstanding Fees and will be reflected in the Invoice for such transaction.</p>
                <p style="font-weight: 600;">6.3</p>
                <p>ACCOUNT ACTIVATION FEE. An “Account Activation Fee” is due at the time of account setup and is non-refundable. This fee is used to cover a variety of services including (but not limited to) account setup and creation, training and help resources, and support.</p>
                <p style="font-weight: 600;">6.4</p>
                <p>MLS FEE. When not already included in your platform fee, you as the client may be responsible to pay an “MLS Fee” to Lofty used for managing MLS documentation, processing applications, and cover MLS vendor fees. Multiple MLS feeds are subject to additional charges as determined by Lofty at the then current pricing structure and as communicated to you at the time of addition.</p>
                <p style="font-weight: 600;">6.5</p>
                <p>CONTRACT DURATION. You hereby agree to abide by the duration of the contract stated in your Subscription Agreement. Renewal and Cancellation policies are outlined separately below.</p>
                <p style="font-weight: 600;">6.6</p>
                <p>PAYMENT COLLECTIONS. As part of registering or submitting information to receive Services, you also authorize us (either directly or through our affiliates, subsidiaries, or other third parties) to request and collect payment (or otherwise charge, refund, or take any other billing actions) from our payment provider or your designated banking account, and to make any inquiries we or our subsidiaries or affiliates may consider necessary to validate your designated payment account or financial information, in order to ensure prompt payment, including for the purpose of receiving updated payment details from your payment, credit card or banking account provider (e.g., updated expiry date or card number as may be provided to us by your credit card company). When you receive a charge on your payment method for your Lofty Subscription, it will show as being from Lofty Inc.</p>
                <p style="font-weight: 600;">6.7</p>
                <p>INVOICING. Should you require an invoice or credit memo, we and/or our subsidiary or affiliated companies can assist you by issuing an Invoice for any payment of Fees or refund made to or by us ("Invoice"). Each Invoice will be issued in electronic form and based on the country stated in your billing address and will be made available to you via your Member Account and/or by email. For the purpose of issuing the Invoice, you may be required to furnish certain personal information in order to comply with local laws. Please note that the Invoice presented in your Member Account may be inadequate with your local law requirements, and in such case, may be used for pro forma purposes only.</p>
                <p style="font-weight: 600;">6.8</p>
                <p>AUTOMATIC RENEWAL. To ensure that you do not experience any interruption or loss of services due to the lapse of any particular subscription period, the Services operate with automatic renewal, on a recurring-fees basis (except where explicitly stated otherwise by us in writing). We will automatically renew the applicable Services according to the scenario listed here based on your Subscription Agreement type which will be one of the following:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Monthly Agreement. Your Services will be automatically renewed for another calendar month after the current month has ended. You will be automatically charged the applicable Fees using the payment method you have on file with us. At the end of each term, this Agreement shall automatically renew unless terminated by either party in writing before the next Billing Cycle prior to the expiration of the then-current term.</li>
                        <li>Contract Agreement. Regardless of the initial contract duration, your Services will be auto-renewed for a one-year period at 12:00.01 a.m. on the day after the contract end date unless terminated by either party in writing at least ninety (90) calendar days prior to the contract end date.</li>
                    </ol>
                <p>You will be automatically charged the applicable Fees using the payment method you have on file with us. At the end of each term, this Agreement shall automatically renew unless terminated by either party in writing before the next Billing Cycle prior to the expiration of the then-current term. If you received a discount or other promotional offer, we shall have the right to automatically and without notice renew your subscription to such Services at the full applicable Fee.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, you are and shall be solely responsible for verifying and ensuring the successful renewal of the Services you use (whether or not such Services are subject to automatic subscription renewals).</p>
                <p style="font-weight: 600;">6.9</p>
                <p>LATE OR UNSUCCESSFUL PAYMENTS. If your payment is unsuccessful within five working days, we will contact you to resolve the situation. If after seven working days we fail to make contact with you, then we reserve the right to cancel the Services and charge any outstanding fees accordingly. Failure to comply with any material term of this Agreement or failure to pay any Fee due under this Agreement, may result in suspension of access (until full payment is made) or cancellation your Member Account (or certain features thereof) and the provision of any related Services or Third Party Services to you.</p>
                <p style="font-weight: 600;">6.10</p>
                <p>CANCELLATION AND FAILURE TO COMPLY. Failure to comply with any material term of this Agreement or failure to pay any Fee when due under this Agreement may result in suspension of access (until full payment is made) or cancellation of your Member Account (or certain features thereof) and the provision of any related Services or Third Party Services to you.</p>
                <p>You may discontinue use and request to cancel your Member Account or any Services at any time by contacting the Lofty Support Team (<a href="mailto:support@lofty.com">support@lofty.com</a>). You shall be solely responsible for the discontinuation of any Services purchased by you. Purchased Services, including those purchase on or through the Services and Add-Ons, are non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for Account Activation Fees, partial months of service, upgrading/downgrading, or unused months. You may cancel your Account and Services according to the terms that correspond to the contract length agreed upon in your Subscription Agreement. These terms are as follows:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Monthly Agreement. You may request to cancel at any time. You will be billed one more full monthly fee prior to Cancellation and then your account and the accounts of any other users on it will be scheduled for deactivation on the last day of the month following the current month regardless of when Cancelled.</li>
                        <li>Contract Agreement. When canceling an agreement with a defined contract duration, you will be required to pay the remaining contract value upon cancellation. If fees were paid in advance (prepaid) in accordance with a contract, no refunds will be made available by Lofty. Such Contract Agreement may be terminated by either party without cause when written notice is provided at least ninety (90) calendar days prior to the contract end date.</li>
                        <li>You shall be solely responsible with respect to the discontinuation of any Services previously purchased by you, including due to a cancellation, failure to pay the applicable recurring Fees including due to failure of your payment method on file to accept the recurring charge, or due to any Services not being subject to automatic subscription renewals. You acknowledge and agree that you shall not have any claims against us in relation to the discontinuation of any Services or Third Party Services, for whatever reason.</li>
                    </ol>
                <p style="font-weight: 600;">6.11</p>
                <p>CHARGEBACKS. If, at any time, you contact your bank or credit card company and decline, chargeback or otherwise reject the charge of any payable Fees (collectively, a "Chargeback"), this will constitute a breach of your payment obligations hereunder, your use of the Services may be automatically terminated, your Member Account may be blocked and any data contained in such Member Account may be subject to cancellation and Capacity Loss (as defined in this Agreement). If you have any questions or concerns regarding a payment made to us, we encourage you to first contact our Support Team at <a href="mailto:support@lofty.com">support@lofty.com</a> before filing a Chargeback with your financial institution.</p>
                <p style="font-weight: 600;">6.12</p>
                <p>SERVICE PROVIDER PAYMENT. You acknowledge and agree that Lofty may, as an accommodation and convenience to you, accept payment of the charges provided for herein from your mortgage lender(s) or other service provider(s) (each a “Service Provider”). Notwithstanding such accommodation, you expressly agree that you shall remain solely liable for prompt payment of all charges and expenses and that Lofty shall have the right to cease providing such accommodation and to bill you directly at any time upon prior notice. You are solely responsible for enlisting the services of a Service Provider and for all use of the Platform by such Service Provider under your account. You represent and warrant that you and any such Service Provider shall be in compliance and shall continue to comply with all applicable laws related to your payment and shared services arrangement with the Service Provider. Lofty shall have no liability for any and all arrangements between you and the Service Provider which impact the progress or results of Lofty’s services to you. Lofty shall have no responsibility for any agreements, arrangements, or liabilities that occur between you and the Service Provider.</p>
                    <ul class="upper-roman">
                        <li>Should Lofty fail to receive payment from the Service Provider, you will pay the full amount due. Both you and the Service Provider will be notified via email. You will be able to re-invite the Service Provider and the Service Provider will not be charged for the previous payment failure. Upon the Service Provider’s confirmation and receipt of updated payment information, the Service Provider’s next payment will be charged when you are next billed by Lofty.</li>
                        <li>The agreed percentage cost allocation you and the Service Provider must be in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations including any relevant obligations that might apply to either you or the Service Provider. Note that for Section 8 of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, 12 USC § 2607, (“RESPA”), compliance by you and the Service Provider regarding a cost allocation percentage should be based upon relative benefits and value to be received by each party from the Service during co-marketing.</li>
                    </ul>
                <p style="font-weight: 600;">6.13</p>
                <p>CHARGES FOR NEW FEATURES. Features of the Lofty CRM and Lofty Real Estate Website and other Services may change from time to time and Lofty reserves the right to charge for new features that may be included in future CRM releases. We may change, suspend, or terminate any of the Services (or any features thereof, or prices thereof), at any time and in any manner. Such changes may become effective upon notice to you (and in any event, not in a retroactive manner - except as required otherwise by law). If any such changes involve the payment of additional Fees, we will provide you with a notice of such Fees prior to enabling such specific changes. If you fail or refuse to pay such Fees, we may cancel your Member Account, continue to support your then-current Services without enabling such changes, or provide you with alternative Services.</p>
                <p style="font-weight: 600;">6.14</p>
                <p>PAYMENT FOR TECH RESOURCES. In certain scenarios, and only with prior written agreement by both you and Lofty, Lofty may commit to developing temporary technology solutions (“Manual Tech Solutions”) to address your individual requests to perform actions such as transfer or copy website content, apply mass actions to records within the Services, or accomplish other miscellaneous tasks as needs may arise. These scenarios are reated as individual requests and addressed on a case-by-case basis. Lofty reservers the right to (a) deny requests regardless of the circumstances, (b) charge a custimization fee to you for building and implementing a one-off solution, and (c) provide and adjust timelines for any agreed-upon work based on resource availability.</p>

Any use of the Services not expressly permitted by these Terms of Use is a breach of these Terms of Use and may violate copyright, trademark, or other laws.</p>
                <p style="font-weight: 600;">7.7</p>
                <p>LEAD OWNERSHIP. All Lead data belongs to you as the user and will not be shared with or be accessible to Lofty except for authorized support purpose. Your Lead data will remain only in your instance of the platform and will only be transferred when a manual account transfer to another Lofty instance has been requested and approved by you. Lofty will never distribute or share your Lead data unless requested to do so.</p>
                <p>All leads designated within an account database as Private Leads (“Private Leads”) will only be visible to the user who has added them, with the only exception to this rule occurring if a written request is submitted to the Lofty Support Team (<a href="mailto:support@lofty.com">support@lofty.com</a>) by the owner of the account where this user exists. In this scenario, these leads will be changed from “Private Leads” to “Team/Company Leads.”</p>
                <p style="font-weight: 600;">7.8</p>
                <p>ACCOUNT TRANSFER PROCESS. An individual user on a Lofty account may coordinate with Lofty to create a new and independent Lofty account at any time. Any Private Leads, private email, text templates, or other settings that belong to that user can be transferred from the source account to the destination account without the need for additional approval from the account owner. However, if the user also desires to transfer other account-level content that is not private and belonging only to their individual login, approval must be obtained by the source account owner prior to transfer taking place. This process can be coordinated with the Lofty Support Team.</p>
                <p style="font-weight: 600;" id="language_currency">7.9</p>

                <div class="h2" id="cat20">Data Retention and Storage</div>
                <p>All Personal Information is retained only for as long as it is necessary for the purposes for which it was collected or transferred.

If the data is transferred to counties without “adequate” protection as determined by the European Parliament, we will use additional safeguards to ensure your data is protected.</p>
                <div class="h2" id="cat22">Company Response to a Data Request and/or Security Breach</div>

In some cases, however, we may limit or deny your request if: the law permits or requires us to do so, if it infringes on the privacy of other individuals or internal procedures, if we find the request to be unfounded or excessive, or if we are unable to verify your identity.</p>
                <p>If the volume or complexity of the request requires internal processing at Lofty beyond 30 days, Lofty will inform the requester within 30 days of the reasons for an extension and may charge a reasonable fee to cover administrative costs.</p>
                <p>Security of all information is of the utmost importance for Lofty. Lofty uses technical and physical safeguards to protect the security of your Personal Information from unauthorized disclosure. We use encryption technology to keep all information secure. We also make all attempts to ensure that only necessary people and third parties have access to Personal Information. Nevertheless, such security measures cannot prevent all loss, misuse, or alteration of Personal Information and, unless otherwise agreed in a written agreement between Lofty and the applicable party, we are not responsible for any damages or liabilities relating to any such incidents to the fullest extent permitted by law. In the case of a data breach, we will notify you without undue delay of any loss, misuse or alteration of Personal Information that may affect you. We will notify relevant regulatory bodies within 72 hours of indentifying a breach.</p>

                <p>To facilitate our business practices, your Personal Data may be collected, transferred to, and stored by us in the United States.

                <p>The Fair Information Practices, also known as the Fair Information Practice Principles (FIPPs), form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.</p>
                <p>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We will notify the users via email within seven (7) business days</li>
                        <li>We also agree to the individual redress principle, which requires that individuals have a right to pursue legally enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or a government agency to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.</li>

                <p>The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.</p>
                <p>To be in accordance with CAN-SPAM we agree to the following:</p>
