Welcome to StackBlitz Buddy. We are committed to protecting your personal information and your right to privacy. This privacy policy applies to all information collected through our web service.

Information We Collect
StackBlitz Buddy is a service that communicates with a Node.js service, hosted on Heroku services, to temporarily host the prototyped webapps. We collect the information that is sent through HTTP endpoints by either people or OpenAI's ChatGPT, for the sole purpose of providing the prototyping and programming educational aim of StackBlitz Buddy. Users are responsible for any personal data included within the content they upload or send via endpoints.
