            <p class="fs-body2 lh-lg fc-black-500">If you decline to provide us with personal information when we ask you, you may not be able to access all or some of our services, and you may not be able to use the Network or certain Products and Services. For example, if you do not provide us with your email address or other information required for account registration, we will not be able to register you for certain account services.</p>
            <p class="fs-body2 lh-lg fc-black-500">We collect:</p>
            <p class="fs-body2 lh-lg fc-black-500"><strong>Identity Data</strong> </p>
            <p class="fs-body2 lh-lg fc-black-500">We collect information such as your username, password, email address, IP address (collected at each site visit). This information is also used to identify individual users to the Public Network and to award activities and attribute them to you. Your username and additional content you provide, including your profile picture, question and answer content, and your reputation, are visible publicly. We or our community moderators may delete a question, an answer, a comment, or all of them and after deletion such information is only available to certain community members or Stack employees.</p>
            <p class="fs-body2 lh-lg fc-black-500"><strong>Contact Data</strong>: including delivery address, email address, and telephone numbers for operational purposes, including providing Services and Products.</p>
            <p class="fs-body2 lh-lg fc-black-500"><strong>Technical Data</strong>: including internet protocol (IP) address, your login data, traffic data, browser type and version, time zone setting and location, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system, and platform and other communication data which gives us information about how you accessed our website. Other account information and usage information including your IP address and browser data may be used for diagnosis, security, and Product and Service optimization.</p>
            <p class="fs-body2 lh-lg fc-black-500"><strong>Account registration information</strong></p>
            <p class="fs-body2 lh-lg fc-black-500">When you register for a Stack Overflow account, we collect your name and email address, your username and any additional information you provide. We will generate a unique identification number that we will use to recognize you when you are signed in. We need to collect your personal information for account registration purposes. Although the Network provides for anonymous and pseudonymous participation, in some instances in order to use certain Products or Services, we require account registration. This requires a name associated with your account, an email address at which we can contact you, and in some cases, additional information, including a contact address, a billing address, and a password to help secure your personal information.</p>
            <p class="fs-body2 lh-lg fc-black-500"><strong>Billing information</strong></p>
            <p class="fs-body2 lh-lg fc-black-500">For Products and Services requiring payment, we collect a billing name, phone number, and email address. We also collect a billing and shipping address for invoicing purposes. If you elect to pay by credit card, Stack Overflow may engage a third party to securely process your payment. All payment processing is done through a PCI DSS compliant third party. If customers are paying by a credit card, their card details are vaulted through a third-party payment gateway. Stack Overflow will store an encrypted token along with the last four digits of the credit card and the expiration month and year of the card and will not store or retain any other billing information about you.</p>
            <p class="fs-body2 lh-lg fc-black-500"><strong>Profile information</strong></p>
            <p class="fs-body2 lh-lg fc-black-500">When completing a public “profile”, whether it is for use with the Network or our Products and Services, we may require you to share certain personally identifying information in required and optional profile fields. The name associated with your account, which you may review and change in your account settings, as well as reputation points are publicly displayed and connected to your activity on the Stack Overflow Network and via certain Products and Services, such as our Talent and Teams platforms. Moderators, who have elevated access privileges, may access non-public user profile data, as well as content in posts and other public data. For more information about moderators and their role in the Stack Exchange Network, please visit <a href="/help/site-moderators">our help center</a>.</p>
            <p class="fs-body2 lh-lg fc-black-500">Other profile information may also be publicly displayed if you choose to complete certain elective components of the Account Registration options, including e.g., your Developer Story, display picture, affiliated role and company, your location, and your preferred technologies (javascript, swift, sql-server, etc.), and some information is publicly displayed and required, such as how long you have been a member.</p>
            <p class="fs-body2 lh-lg fc-black-500">Similarly, you may elect to share additional information that is not required, but this will be displayed publicly if you so choose to share it.</p>
            <p class="fs-body2 lh-lg fc-black-500">If you are using the private Network (e.g., Stack Overflow for Teams), your account settings, including name, affiliated role and company, and other information may be shared with your private Network Team members designated as authorized users of your private Network account. While some of the public and private Network profile information is required, much of it is within your control as we describe herein and can be modified, updated, and restricted by you in your settings.</p>
            <p class="fs-body2 lh-lg fc-black-500"><strong>Information we use to identify and authenticate you</strong></p>
            <p class="fs-body2 lh-lg fc-black-500">We need this information to be able to recognize you, for example, when you access your accounts. It also helps us to protect your details and keep them secure. We may also use this information for fraud detection and prevention. </p>
            <p class="fs-body2 lh-lg fc-black-500"><strong>Analytics information</strong></p>
            <p class="fs-body2 lh-lg fc-black-500">Stack Overflow uses data analytics to ensure site functionality and to optimize our Product and Service offerings to you. We use web browser and mobile analytics to allow us to understand Network and Apps functionality. In doing so, we record information including, for example, how often you visit the Network, how often you contribute content, Network and Apps performance data, errors and debugging information, and the type of activity you engage in while on the Network or in your use of our Products and Services. We may on occasion share this information with third parties with whom we have contracts for products and services to assist Stack.</p>
            <p class="fs-body2 lh-lg fc-black-500"><strong>Information from Developer surveys, questionnaires, research and feedback programs</strong></p>
            <p class="fs-body2 lh-lg fc-black-500">We collect information through questionnaires, surveys and feedback programs to help improve our products and give us insights. We may also conduct similar research for advertisers and our marketing partners. We ask you for your consent to use this information when you participate in these programs and events.</p>
            <p class="fs-body2 lh-lg fc-black-500"><strong>Marketing and sales information</strong></p>
            <p class="fs-body2 lh-lg fc-black-500">We collect details of the services you receive and your preferences; information about your device or the software you use, e.g., its IP address, technical specification and uniquely identifying data; cookies and similar technologies we use to recognize you, remember your preferences and tailor the content we provide to you – our <a href="/legal/cookie-policy">cookie policy</a> contains more details about how we use cookies.</p>
            <p class="fs-body2 lh-lg fc-black-500"><strong>Device and browser information received automatically</strong></p>
            <p class="fs-body2 lh-lg fc-black-500">When you visit the Network or use our Apps, Stack Overflow automatically receives and records information from your browser or mobile device, such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address or unique device identifier. Cookies and data about which pages you visit on our Network allow us to operate and optimize the Products and Services we provide to you. This information is stored in secure logs and is collected automatically.</p>
            <p class="fs-body2 lh-lg fc-black-500">We may combine this browser information with other information we collect about you. This information is used to keep the Products and Services secure, to analyze and understand how our Products and Services are used, optimize such usage, provide advertising across the Network as well as certain Products and Services to personalize your experience, and to help connect you with potential job opportunities in the case of our recruiting Products and Services.</p>
            <p class="fs-body2 lh-lg fc-black-500"><strong>Location information</strong></p>
            <p class="fs-body2 lh-lg fc-black-500">When you use the Stack Overflow Network, and certain of our Products and Services, we collect location information about you, including your IP address, your location, browser information, and how you came to the Stack Overflow Network. This is the case for individuals who have registered for an account, and non-members who engage with the Stack Overflow Network by visiting our website(s), but who have not completed an account registration.</p>
            <p class="fs-body2 lh-lg fc-black-500">This information is collected for various purposes, including advertising, analytics and to serve content as it relates to certain Products or Services (e.g., Talent), as well as to provide you with localized content, recommendations, and marketing. You may revoke our permission to collect some of this data, including your location and browser information through your Account Settings, but this may limit functionality in some cases. Certain location information we collect is required for security and site functionality. We share this information with certain third-parties (e.g., talent recruiters, payment processors, and advertising providers) in order to provide you with our Products and Services.</p>
            <p class="fs-body2 lh-lg fc-black-500">You should not include any financial information or other information that you do not wish to make public when using our Public Network, which is a public website. We do not collect such information. It is your responsibility to keep such information safe and secure.</p>
            <p class="fs-body2 lh-lg fc-black-500"><strong>Can I revoke permissions once I have put information on the Public Network?</strong></p>
            <p class="fs-body2 lh-lg fc-black-500">Please be aware that when using the Public Question and Answer Network, you cannot revoke permission for Stack Overflow to publish and to allow others to have derivative rights to such public content once it is made public.</p>
            <p class="fs-body2 lh-lg fc-black-500">The content you contribute on the public network is public, in perpetuity, and Stack Overflow loses direct control over such content when it is published on the open internet. This also means that if you post personal information about yourself, you do so at your own risk, including the risk of abandoning any privacy rights you had in such information. However, we can work with users to remove any personal data that has been posted in error or which a user wishes to remove.</p>
            <p class="fs-body2 lh-lg fc-black-500">Additionally, from time to time, Stack Overflow makes such public content available via our Stack Overflow Network API, compilation via the Creative Commons Data Dump and by providing public content to the Stack Overflow Network. You should be aware that such content, once public, cannot often be removed from public view even if it is removed from the Stack Overflow network and our servers.</p>

            <p class="fs-body2 lh-lg fc-black-500">When you visit our Network and sites or when you use our apps, we may collect personal data from you automatically using cookies or similar technologies. A cookie is a small file that can be placed on your device that allows us to recognize and remember you. We may place cookies on your device (with your consent, where applicable), as well as partner with third parties, including advertising partners, who may use cookies or other similar technologies to provide you with advertising based on your browsing activities and interests. Please see our <a href="/legal/cookie-policy">cookie policy</a> for additional information on how we use cookies and what third party cookies we permit.</p>
            <p class="fs-body2 lh-lg fc-black-500"><strong>Tracking</strong></p>
            <p class="fs-body2 lh-lg fc-black-500">Stack Overflow emails use Javascript for email tracking of opens, clicks, and unsubscribes or may contain a small, invisible, one pixel image which can be used to let us know when the email is opened or forwarded. If the email recipient has images enabled on their device, when the email is opened, a message (an automatic request) is sent to Stack Overflow’s server requesting the image. That request is logged by Stack Overflow and tells us that the email has been opened. A similar process may be used in relation to links or attachments in the email, with a request being sent to Stack Overflow for the content that is accessible via the links or attachments, thus telling Stack Overflow that the link or attachment has been accessed.</p>
            <p class="fs-body2 lh-lg fc-black-500"><strong>Developer Survey </strong></p>
            <p class="fs-body2 lh-lg fc-black-500">As the world’s largest developer community, Stack Overflow publishes an annual Developer Survey to provide key insights into the developer community, as well as other surveys from time to time, some of which include demographic (e.g., gender, race, age, etc.) and certain personal information. Your participation in the Developer Survey as well as any other Stack Overflow survey is entirely voluntary. In order to provide meaningful insights into the developer community, Stack Overflow may collect sensitive data about you, including, but not limited to your gender, race, sexual orientation, immigration status, and your location. We consider this data to be among our most sensitive and have taken elevated measures to protect such data as well as to de-identify your name and other personal information from such data. We restrict such data within Stack Overflow on a privileged basis to only those that need to see it and while we may share your personal information with our third party providers for our research, we do so only after imposing contractual obligations of confidentiality on such third parties and only where necessary for limited research purposes.</p>
            <p class="fs-body2 lh-lg fc-black-500">When we publish our surveys, they are published as a compilation of anonymized data. We may ask for your consent to contact you following completion of the surveys. </p>
            <p class="fs-body2 lh-lg fc-black-500">If you have any questions concerning the Developer Survey or other survey and our security measures to protect your sensitive personal data, please contact us at: <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#7c0c0e150a1d1f053c0f081d1f17130a190e1a10130b521f1311"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="601012091601031920131401030b0f160512060c0f174e030f0d">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.</p>
