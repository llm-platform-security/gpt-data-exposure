Introduction:</strong><br/><br/>Welcome to Insight Bridge. As a platform dedicated to providing insightful analytics and leveraging the power of AI, we prioritize the privacy and protection of our users&#x27; data. Our commitment is not just about adhering to regulations, but genuinely valuing the trust you place in us. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, store, and safeguard your information. By interacting with our platform and services, you&#x27;re agreeing to these practices. We encourage you to read through this document thoroughly to understand our approach towards data privacy.<br/><br/><strong>2.	Information Collection:</strong><br/><br/>User Authentication:<br/>‍<br/>Our user authentication process is managed by Auth0. This involves the collection of your email address and password to facilitate the login procedure. For a detailed understanding of how Auth0 manages and protects your data, please refer to Auth0&#x27;s Privacy Policy.<br/><br/>Integration of Data Sources: <br/>‍<br/>When you integrate a new data source with our platform, specific identifiers and access parameters are stored. For Google Analytics, this includes property_ids of properties you wish to query. All access and refresh tokens related to data source integration are encrypted using industry-standard protocols before storage in our database.<br/><br/>Future Data Sources: <br/><br/>As we integrate additional data sources, rest assured that sensitive access credentials, tokens, and related information will always be encrypted before being stored in our database.<br/><br/><strong>3.	Website Interaction:</strong><br/><br/>Information Collection via Google Analytics:<br/>‍<br/>We utilize Google Analytics on our landing page to gain insights into user interactions, behaviors, and traffic patterns. This tool helps us understand how visitors engage with our website, which allows us to improve user experience and tailor our content better.<br/><br/>The types of information collected include, but are not limited to: pages visited, time spent on pages, devices used to access the site, user&#x27;s geographic location, referral sources, and bounce rate.<br/><br/>Use of Cookies:<br/><br/>Google Analytics uses cookies, which are small files placed on your device, to collect and store information about your visit and interaction with our landing page. These cookies do not collect personal information or identify individual users.<br/><br/>Data Usage and Sharing:<br/><br/>The data collected via Google Analytics is used exclusively for analytical purposes. We review this data to enhance our website&#x27;s performance and optimize content for our users.<br/><br/>We do not share, sell, or lease this data to third parties. Google may aggregate this data across multiple sites, but it remains anonymized and does not identify individual users.<br/><br/>Opting Out:<br/><br/>If you wish to opt-out of Google Analytics tracking, you can do so by installing the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on. This add-on prevents the Google Analytics JavaScript from sharing information with Google Analytics about website activity.<br/><br/>Data Protection:<br/><br/>Google Analytics employs robust data security measures. All data is transmitted securely and stored in Google&#x27;s secure data centers. Additionally, we have ensured that our use of Google Analytics is compliant with privacy regulations.<br/><br/><strong>4.	Data Usage:</strong><br/><br/>Primary Function: <br/><br/>The data we retrieve from integrated data sources is crucial for the primary functionality of our app. It is processed and analyzed by our AI system to respond to user queries, offer insights, or provide an analytical breakdown based on the user&#x27;s request.<br/><br/>App Improvement: <br/><br/>We may utilize the data to identify potential areas of improvement in the app&#x27;s features or to introduce new functionalities that benefit our users.<br/><br/>Third-Party Access:<br/><br/>Third-party platforms, including our hosting platform, Fly.io, and our logging system, BetterStack, have limited access to certain data retrieved through the reporting API’s such as Google Analytics 4. We recommend users review Fly.io&#x27;s Privacy Policy and BetterStack&#x27;s Privacy Policy for a deeper understanding of their data handling practices.<br/><br/><strong>5.	Data Storage and Security:</strong><br/><br/>Database: <br/><br/>We trust MongoDB Atlas for our data storage needs, where data is secured using SSL/TLS X.509 certificates. Moreover, sensitive data, such as access and refresh tokens, undergo an added layer of encryption using the Fernet encryption method.<br/><br/>Compliance Standards: We are committed to ensuring the highest standards of data security and compliance. Our platforms and tools are chosen with a meticulous focus on security, and we regularly review and update our practices.<br/><br/>We recommend users review the MongoDB Privacy Policy for a detailed understanding of how the analytics data of their Google Analytics (in future Meta/TikTok) will be handled.<br/><br/><strong>6.

Beta Testing and User Selection:</strong><br/><br/>Please note that Insight Bridge is currently in its beta phase. As a result, access to the app is limited to specific users who have been chosen for the testing phase. Being in beta also means we are actively refining and improving our services, and this might have implications on the data we collect and how we use it. We always prioritize user privacy and data protection, even during this testing phase. If there are significant changes to our data practices due to the app&#x27;s beta status, we will promptly communicate them to our selected users.<br/><br/><strong>10.
