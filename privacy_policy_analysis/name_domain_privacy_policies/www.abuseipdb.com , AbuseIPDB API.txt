This data transfer outside the EEA is legitimate if the recipient of the data is located in a country which provides an adequate level of protection following a European Commission adequacy decision. Some of these countries may not have equivalent data protection legislation to protection the use of your PII.

</p>
<h4>7. <u>Retention of Data.</u> </h4>
<p>

</p>
<p>
California residents have a right to request that we disclose what PII we collect from you and whether, and how, we disclose or sell that PII. California residents may also request that we delete any personal information collected or maintained by us from you.
</p>
<p>

To learn more about interest-based advertising across websites and additional opt-out choices, you can visit <a href="http://optout.aboutads.info" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://optout.aboutads.info</a>.

</p>
<p>
