                <h2> PolyTech Forum Privacy Policy</h2>
                <p>If you require any more information or have any questions about our privacy policy, please feel free
                    to contact us by visiting our <a title="PolyTech Forum Contact Page" href="https://www.polytechforum.com/contact">contact
                        form page </a></p>
                <p>At <em>PolyTech Forum</em>, the privacy of our visitors is of extreme importance to us. This privacy
                    policy document outlines what type of personal information is collected and stored by <em>PolyTech Forum</em>
                    and how it is used.
                </p>

                <h3>Website Visitors</h3>
                Like most website operators, <em>PolyTech Forum</em> collects non-personally-identifying information of
                the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language
                preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. <em>PolyTech Forum</em>'s
                purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how <em>PolyTech Forum</em>'s
                visitors use its website. From time to time, <em>PolyTech Forum</em> may release
                non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the
                usage of its website.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <em>PolyTech Forum</em> also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet
                    Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on
                    <em>PolyTech Forum</em> forums. <em>PolyTech Forum</em> only discloses logged in user and
                    commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses
                    personally-identifying information as described below, except that blog commenter IP addresses are
                    visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog where the comment was left.
                </p>

                <p>
                <h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
                Certain visitors to <em>PolyTech Forum</em>'s websites choose to interact with <em>PolyTech Forum</em>
                in ways that require <em>PolyTech Forum</em> to gather personally-identifying information. The amount
                and type of information that <em>PolyTech Forum</em> gathers depends on the nature of the interaction.
                For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a forum user account at <em>PolyTech Forum</em> to provide
                a username and email address. We advise users not to use their real names for the username as this
                information is shown publicly on pages of this website. Email address is not shown publicly. In each
                case, <em>PolyTech Forum</em> collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to
                fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with <em>PolyTech Forum</em>. <em>PolyTech Forum</em>
                does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can
                always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them
                from engaging in certain website-related activities.
                </p>

                <p>
                <h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3>
                <em>PolyTech Forum</em> may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. <em>PolyTech Forum</em>
                may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, <em>PolyTech Forum</em> does
                not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
                </p>

                <p>
                <h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
                <em>PolyTech Forum</em> discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
                information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to
                know that information in order to process it on <em>PolyTech Forum</em>'s behalf or to provide services
                available at <em>PolyTech Forum</em>'s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to
                others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your
                home country; by using <em>PolyTech Forum</em>'s websites, you consent to the transfer of such
                information to them. <em>PolyTech Forum</em> will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying
                and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and
                affiliated organizations, as described above, <em>PolyTech Forum</em> discloses potentially
                personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court
                order or other governmental request, or when <em>PolyTech Forum</em> believes in good faith that
                disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of <em>PolyTech Forum</em>, third
                parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an <em>PolyTech Forum</em> website and
                have supplied your email address, <em>PolyTech Forum</em> may occasionally send you an email to tell
                you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with
                <em>PolyTech Forum</em> and our products. We expect to keep this type of email communication to a
                minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback
                mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request
                or to help us support other users. <em>PolyTech Forum</em> takes all measures reasonably necessary to
                protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially
                personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
                </p>

                <h3>Cookies</h3>
                A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the
                visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. <em>PolyTech Forum</em> uses
                cookies to help <em>PolyTech Forum</em> identify and track visitors, their usage of
                <em>PolyTech Forum</em> website, and their website access preferences. <em>PolyTech Forum</em>
                visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse
                cookies before using <em>PolyTech Forum</em>'s websites, with the drawback that certain features of
                <em>PolyTech Forum</em>'s website may not function properly without the aid of cookies.
                </p>

                <p>
                <h3>Business Transfers</h3>
                If <em>PolyTech Forum</em>, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event
                that <em>PolyTech Forum</em> goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one
                of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may
                occur, and that any acquiror of <em>PolyTech Forum</em> may continue to use your personal information
                as set forth in this policy.
                </p>

                <p>
                <h3>Ads</h3>
                Ads appearing on our website may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies.
                These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online
                advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows
                ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most
                interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by <em>PolyTech Forum</em> and does not
                cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.
