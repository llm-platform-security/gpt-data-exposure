Rewards Program 





</u></span><br></p><p>The MyLowe’s Rewards Program provides MLR Members with certain benefits and offers (as described further herein) (collectively “<b>MyLowe’s Rewards</b>”), unless prohibited by applicable law, based on Personal Account Holder’s accrued spend on Eligible Purchases (as defined below) or other actions or opportunities as may be presented by Lowe’s from time to time in Lowe’s sole discretion. MLR Members are placed in MyLowe’s Rewards Statuses (as defined below) based on the MLR Member’s accrued spend. The MyLowe’s Rewards Statuses determine the rate a MLR Member earns points on Eligible Purchases towards MyLowe’s Money rewards (“<b>MyLowe’s Money</b>”) that can be applied towards future Lowe’s purchases and may determine other benefits.&nbsp;</p><p>There is no fee associated with the MyLowe’s Rewards Program.

The initial MyLowe’s Rewards Program Period is effective on the date the MyLowe’s Rewards Program becomes available in your area (see Program Rollout and Location Launch Calendar below) to December 31, 2024. Each subsequent MyLowe’s Rewards Program Period will be effective January 1 to December 31 of each calendar year, unless otherwise stated herein (each separate calendar year is a “<span style="font-weight: bold;">MyLowe’s Rewards Program Period</span>”). Lowe’s may, in its sole and exclusive discretion, designate different MyLowe’s Rewards Program Periods or modify, shorten or extend any MyLowe’s Rewards Program Period.

If you wish to deactivate your Account or delete your information, please contact us at 1-800-445-6937.<br></li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Eligible Purchases: </span>“<span style="font-weight: bold;">Eligible Purchases</span>” are MyLowe’s Tracked Purchases that have been settled and fulfilled and appear on the Personal Account purchase history excluding: rental fees; labor services and special fees; warranties; Lowe’s Protection Plans; shipping and handling; delivery; surcharges; service fees; sales and use taxes; product fees, purchases of Lowe’s Gift Cards or other third-party Gift Cards,&nbsp; or purchases or transactions made with MyLowe’s Rewards, including MyLowe’s Money, or other promotional items (such as free items), or purchases made using payment tender currently saved to an existing PRO Account.<br></li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">MyLowe’s Rewards Program Status.</span> The MyLowe’s Rewards Program has different membership levels (each a “<span style="font-weight: bold;">MyLowe’s Rewards Status</span>”), which is based on the MLR Member’s cumulative, accrued spend on Eligible Purchases in the applicable MyLowe’s Rewards Program Period. See <span style="font-weight: bold;">Table 2.2</span> below for the spend thresholds for each Status. MLR Members can reach one or more of the following MyLowe’s Rewards Program Statuses within a given MyLowe’s Rewards Program Period: Bronze Key, Silver Key, Gold Key. Each Status provides MLR Members with access to unique MyLowe’s Rewards Program benefits and offers, including lower spend threshold to receive free shipping, as discussed in detail below. Lowe’s in its sole discretion, may provide certain MLR Members with Silver Key Status based on criteria other than cumulative, accrued spend on Eligible Purchases. In such instances, these customers must still meet the accrued spend threshold in <span style="font-weight: bold;">Table 2.2</span> to achieve the next Status. For example, a MLR Member receives Silver Key Status at a time MLR Member has $0 in accrued Eligible Purchase spend; such MLR Member must reach $2,000 of Eligible Purchase spend to achieve Gold Key Status.<br><br>During a MyLowe’s Rewards Program Period, MLR Member may move up into one or more MyLowe’s Rewards Statuses based on the MLR Member’s accrued Eligible Purchases. Once a MLR Member reaches a certain MyLowe’s Rewards Status, the MLR Member will maintain that MyLowe’s Status for the remainder of the MyLowe’s Rewards Program Period and the subsequent MyLowe’s Rewards Program Period provided Eligible Purchases are not returned. If a MLR Member does not make enough Eligible Purchases by the end of a given MyLowe’s Rewards Program Period to maintain the MyLowe’s Rewards Status reached the previous MyLowe’s Reward Program Period, then the MLR Member will begin the subsequent Program Period at the lower MyLowe’s Rewards Status that corresponds to the MLR Member’s actual accrued spend from Eligible Purchases made in the preceding MyLowe’s Rewards Program Period. A MLR Member’s Eligible Purchase accrued spend will reset to zero at the beginning of each new MyLowe’s Rewards Program Period. Lowe’s reserves the right to change, modify or update the requirements needed to earn each MyLowe’s Rewards Status (including, without limitation, the minimum amount of accrued spend required) and determine a MLR Member’s starting MyLowe’s Rewards Status for any MyLowe’s Rewards Program Period in its sole discretion.<br><br></li><li><b>Lower Threshold for Free Standard Shipping Benefit (Not Available in AK &amp; HI).</b> MLR Members may receive free standard shipping on eligible purchases if they meet a minimum purchase threshold. For example, MLR Members in the Bronze Key Status will receive free standard shipping on eligible purchases of $35 or more, subject to certain exclusions. MLR Members in the Silver and Gold Key Statuses will receive free standard shipping on eligible purchases without any minimum spend required.

MLR Members in the Bronze Key Status will earn 1 My Point per dollar spent on an Eligible Purchases; MLR Members in the Silver Key Status will earn 1.25 My Points per dollar spent on Eligible Purchases; and MLR Members in the Gold Key Status will earn 1.5 My Points per dollar spent on an Eligible Purchases. For illustrative purposes only, if a MLR Member in Silver Status made a $95 Eligible Purchase, the approximate number of My Points awarded would be 118.75 My Points.<br><br>Each MyLowe’s Rewards Status and the My Points accrual rate is progressive, meaning the applicable percentage will only apply to the Eligible Purchase amount MLR Member spent within the applicable Status. Lowe’s will round partial cents to the nearest cent. Two different My Points accrual percentages may apply to one Eligible Purchase. By way of example only, if a MLR Member needed $50 in in Eligible Purchases to move up to a higher MyLowe’s Status and spent $100 on a Eligible Purchase, $50 of such Eligible Purchase will earn My Points at the lower MyLowe’s Rewards Status and the remaining $50 will earn My Points at the higher MyLowe’s Rewards Status.<br><br>Lowe’s in its sole
discretion may offer additional points or a higher rate of points per dollar
spent for certain or select Eligible Purchases. When expressed as a multiplier
of My Points, the My Points awarded will be calculated by multiplying the
Eligible Purchase amount (accounting for MLR Member’s Status) by the stated
multiplier. For example, A Silver Key Status MLR Member makes a $100 Eligible
Purchase with a 2X My Points offer; this MLR Member would earn 250 My Points
($100 x 1.25 x 2 = 250).<br></li><li>&nbsp;<b>Returns of Eligible Purchases.</b>
If an item(s) from an Eligible Purchase is returned, the returned amount will
be deducted from Eligible Purchase accrued spend and My Points. If a return is
made after MyLowe’s Money has been issued, a MLR Member’s Account may reflect a
negative My Points balance.



<br></li></ul></ul><p></p><ul class="list-disc"><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Additional My Points Offerings.</span> From time to time, Lowe’s, or others acting with our permission, may offer MLR Members opportunities to earn My Points for engaging in certain promotional activities; upon achieving certain MyLowe’s Rewards Program milestones; or completing other actions or opportunities as may be presented. My Points for such offerings will be awarded as described in the applicable offer and will be subject to any additional terms set forth within that offer.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">MyLowe’s Rewards Credit Card Holder Benefit.</span> MyLowe’s Rewards Credit Card (‘MLRCC’) holders will be upgraded to Silver Key Status, and have access to Silver Key benefits, when their LAC is saved to their MyLowe’s Rewards Wallet. Certain LAC holders may need to save their LAC card to their MyLowe’s Reward Wallet themselves by following the instructions on the Site. If&nbsp; MLR Member terminates their LAC credit line, the MLR Member’s MyLowe’s Status will be placed in the MyLowe’s Rewards Status that matches their current Eligible Purchases spend accrual. For example, if MLR Member terminates their LAC credit line, and MLR Member’s spend threshold matches Bronze Key, then, the MLR Member will be moved from the Silver Key Status to the Bronze Key Status.<br></li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">MyLowe’s Money.&nbsp;</span> MLR Members will be automatically issued MyLowe’s Money to their Wallet in $5 increments when a MLR Member accrues 1,000 My Points and those My Points will be deducted from the MLR Members My Points balance. MyLowe’s Money can be applied towards future purchases that are made on or&nbsp; before the expiration date set forth on each MyLowe’s Money certificate. If not used within the redemption period, then the MyLowe’s Money expires. If no redemption period or expiration date is stated, then the expiration date will be thirty (30) days from date of its issuance.<br></li><ul class="list-circle"><li>MyLowe’s Money is non-transferrable and is not a credit, debit or gift card; it has no implied warranties. <span style="font-weight: bold;">There is a limit of 5 MyLowe’s Money per transaction.</span> MyLowe’s Money will be applied to a MLR Member’s purchase after all applicable discounts, coupons, taxes and fees have been applied. MyLowe’s Money cannot be exchanged for cash, is void if altered, defaced, copied, transferred, or sold (thru any on-line auction or otherwise). MyLowe’s Money may not be redeemed or used on (1) gift cards, including Lowe’s-branded gift cards; (2) payments to a Lowe’s credit card or any third-party charge account; (3) on any Lowe’s branded website operated by a 3rd party; or (4) Weber, Kichler or Miele products. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Returns: for merchandise purchased with MyLowe’s Money return value will be applied first to payment method and any remaining value will be returned as MyLowe’s Money to customer’s Wallet.</span></li><li>A MLR Member may use a partial amount of their MyLowe’s Money, but the MLR Member cannot dictate the amount of MyLowe’s Money that will be applied towards a purchase (i.e., a MLR Member cannot decide to use a pre-determined amount of MyLowe’s Money on a purchase). If a MLR Member purchases a $3.00 product and uses $3.00 out of the $5.00 available on the MyLowe’s Money certificate, the MLR Member can later apply the remaining $2.00 towards a future purchase that is made within the applicable redemption period.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Returns with MyLowe’s Money.</span> MLR Members who return an item that was purchased with MyLowe’s Money will receive the MyLowe’s Money back to their Account&nbsp; or in the form of one or more In-store Credit (Merchandise Credit) cards in Lowe’s discretion. If the MyLowe’s Money that was used to make the purchase has expired and Lowe’s issues replacement MyLowe’s Money, your MyLowe’s Money will be returned to the Wallet with an updated expiration date. For returns of orders partially paid with MyLowe’s Money, MLR Members will first receive the returned payment to their payment method (cash, credit or debit card) and then any remaining amount will be returned to the MLR Member’s Wallet as MyLowe’s Money or in the form of one or more In-store Credit (Merchandise Credit) cards in Lowe’s discretion.</li></ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Expiration of Benefits; Inactive Accounts.</span> At the end of each MyLowe’s Rewards Program Period, a MLR Member’s accrued Eligible Purchases balance will reset to $0.00. Unclaimed or unused MyLowe’s Rewards, including MyLowe’s Money, expire upon the exit, cancellation or termination of your MyLowe’s Rewards Account as described below. If you have any questions regarding your MyLowe’s Rewards Account status, please contact Lowe’s by calling 1-800-445-6937.&nbsp;<br></li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Suspension or Termination.</span> Lowe’s reserves the right to terminate or suspend a Registered User’s Personal Account if the Personal Account remains inactive for a period of two (2) years or more. Accordingly, if a MLR Member does not make an Eligible Purchase within a two (2) year time period after the MLR Member’s initial Account creation or a MLR Member’s last recorded Eligible Purchase, whichever occurs later, Lowe’s reserves the right to terminate or suspend the Registered User’s Personal Account.

Organizations are placed in MVPs Levels (as defined below) based on their Users’ accrued spend, and the MVPs Levels determine the level of Rewards an Organization earns, as more fully described below. For more information on MVPs Levels, Rewards and Program features and experiences, please visit the <a href="https://www.lowes.com/Pro">MVPs Pro Rewards Program page.</a></li></ul><ul><ul class="list-circle"><li>There is no fee associated with the Program. Your participation in the Program is unique to the Organization under which you are registered for the Program. MVPs Levels and Rewards may not be gifted, purchased, sold, bartered, brokered or otherwise transferred, except that the Program may allow a Primary Admin on behalf of the Organization to allocate certain Rewards in certain limited instances as described below. Rewards available via the MVPs Program have no cash value, are purely promotional and do not constitute property of any User or Organization (as applicable). No portion of any payment for purchases qualifying for the Program or any MVPs Level, Member Benefits or Rewards constitutes consideration paid for the Program or any MVPs Level or Rewards. Lowe’s reserves the right in its sole discretion to limit the claiming or redemption of specific Rewards and to limit the number of MVPs Levels and Rewards available.</li></ul></ul><ul class="list-disc"><li><b style="background-color: transparent;">MVPs Pro Rewards Program Periods.</b><span style="background-color: transparent;"> Participation in the Program is based on consecutive Program Periods, starting in the year in which an Organization joins the MVPs Pro Rewards Program. The initial Program Period is effective from Jan. 7, 2022 to Dec. 31, 2022. Each subsequent Program Period will begin on January 1 of the applicable calendar year.</span></li><li>At the end of each Program Period, all unclaimed Rewards and Member Benefits will be forfeited, subject to the exclusions set forth below. Lowe’s may, in its sole and exclusive discretion, designate a different Program Period or modify, suspend, shorten or extend a Program Period with respect to the Program.</li><li><b style="background-color: transparent;">MVPs Pro Rewards Program Eligibility.</b><span style="background-color: transparent;"> In order to be eligible for the Program, you must have a PRO Account. Government customers and cooperative purchasing programs, including GPOs Parent Organizations, are not eligible for the Program. Resellers are expressly excluded from the MVPs Pro Rewards Program. Commercial customers with a National Account contract are not eligible for MVPs Earn Back Rewards.</span></li><li><b>MVPs Pro Rewards Program Qualifying Purchases.</b>&nbsp;Qualifying purchases include net completed purchases of qualifying products as further detailed below and subject to the exclusions below (“Qualifying&nbsp;Purchases”). “Completed purchases” means the transaction has been settled and fulfilled and the transaction appears on the Organization’s Account purchase history. Qualifying Purchases are PRO Tracked Purchases calculated based on the actual amount paid on any completed purchases of products made by the Organization during the Program Period after any allowable discounts are applied, if any, and excluding: labor services and special fees; warranty; Lowe’s Protection Plans; shipping and handling; delivery; surcharges; service fees; sales and use taxes; and product fees. Qualifying Purchases do not include: (i) purchases of electrical cable and electrical wires; (ii) purchases of Lowe’s Gift Cards or Gift Certificates or other third-party Gift Cards or Gift Certificates; (iii) purchases made using an employee discount (iv) purchases or transactions made with Rewards or other promotional items (such as free items), whether made in store, online or through the Lowe’s app; (v) government purchases; (vi) purchases made for personal use, including any purchase using a Personal Account or Military Discount; or (vii) purchases made on tender previously registered by another Organization. In addition, any purchase of Paint (as defined below) will be a Qualifying Purchase only for the purposes of determining MVPs Level but will not be a Qualifying Purchase for purposes of calculating MVPs Earn Back Rewards.</li></ul><ul><ul class="list-disc"><li>If an item from a Qualifying Purchase is returned, the return amount will be deducted from Qualifying Purchase spend toward earning Rewards. If the item is returned after a Reward has been issued, your Account may reflect a negative balance.</li><li>For a new PRO Account, once your Account is created, Lowe’s will recognize any Qualifying Purchase made online while logged into your Account and any Qualifying Purchase made in store while using Registered Tender or Member ID.</li><li>Qualifying Purchases made between the date of confirmed MVPs Earn Back Rewards eligibility and 12/31/22 will count toward the MVPs Earn Back Rewards calculation as defined below.</li></ul></ul><ul class="list-disc"><li><b>MVPs Levels. </b>Each Organization can reach one or more MVPs Levels: MVPs, Silver MVPs, Gold MVPs, Platinum MVPs (each, an “<b>MVPs Level</b>”) based on the accrued spend within a given Program Period from that Organization’s Users’ Qualifying Purchases. Details regarding the MVPs Levels are available through the <a href="/l/Pro/pro-benefits" title="/l/Pro/pro-benefits">MVPs Pro Rewards Program page</a>. Upon joining the Program, an Organization will be placed in the lowest MVPs Level. As an Organization’s Users make Qualifying Purchases during the applicable Program Period, the Organization may move up into one or more MVPs Levels based on the Organization’s Users’ accrued spend. The Organization will remain in its starting MVPs Level through that Program Period unless and until its Users’ accrued spend on Qualifying Purchases in that same Program Period moves the Organization up into a higher MVPs Level. The highest MVPs Level reached from accrued spend on Qualifying Purchases during a given Program Period will be that Organization’s starting MVPs Level for the subsequent Program Period. If an Organization does not make enough Qualifying Purchases in a given Program Period to maintain its MVPs Level for the subsequent Program Period, the Organization will begin the subsequent Program Period at the lower MVPs Level corresponding to its accrued spend from Qualifying Purchases in that preceding Program Period. Lowe’s reserves the right to change, modify or update the requirements needed to earn each MVPs Level status (including, without limitation, the minimum amount of accrued spend required), Rewards and/or Member Benefits and determine your starting MVPs Level for any Program Period in its sole discretion.</li></ul><ul><ul class="list-circle"><li><b>Summary.</b></li></ul></ul><ul class="list-circle"><ul class="list-circle"><ul><ul class="list-disc"><li>Each Program Period is one year.</li><li>Users’ accrued spend on Qualifying Purchases during a given Program Period determines which MVPs Level the Organization is in for that Program Period. Users’ accrued spend resets to zero at the start of each Program Period.</li><li>The MVPs Level the Organization is in at the end of a given Program Period will be the MVPs Level at which the Organization begins the subsequent Program Period, but the Organization can move up into a higher MVPs Level based on Users’ accrued spend in that subsequent Program Period.</li><li>Organizations do not move down into a lower MVPs Level within the same Program Period. However, an Organization will begin a subsequent Program Period at a lower MVPs Level if the Organization’s Users’ accrued spend on Qualifying Purchases within the immediately preceding Program Period do not meet the minimum amount required to maintain the same MVPs Level.</li></ul></ul></ul><li><b style="background-color: transparent;">MVPs Earn Back Rewards.</b><span style="background-color: transparent;">&nbsp;“</span><b style="background-color: transparent;">MVPs Earn Back Rewards</b><span style="background-color: transparent;">” will be calculated as a percentage of the accrued spend from Qualifying Purchases made during a Program Period by the Organization’s Users, and the Organization’s accrued reward balance will be available to the Primary Admin in the Organization’s Pro Account. MVPs Earn Back Rewards will be issued in the form of electronic Lowe’s Gift Cards (</span><b style="background-color: transparent;">“Lowe’s E-Gift Card”</b><span style="background-color: transparent;"> or </span><b style="background-color: transparent;">“E-Gift Card”</b><span style="background-color: transparent;">) that will appear in the Primary Admin’s Wallet once the accrued reward balance is claimed as an E-Gift Card by the Primary Admin on behalf of the Organization. The percentage is determined by the Organization’s MVPs Level at the time the Qualifying Purchase was made, except if the amount spent on a specific Qualifying Purchase would result in the Organization moving up to a higher MVPs Level, in which case the percentage will be calculated on a pro rata basis (see example below). Only PRO Tracked Purchases will count toward MVPs Earn Back Rewards calculation or MVPs Level determination (i.e., purchases made without using Registered Tender, Member ID or while not signed in to your PRO Account will not count). Paint Qualifying Purchases (as defined below) will not count toward MVPs Earn Back Rewards calculation.</span><br></li><ul class="list-circle"><li><b>MVPs Earn Back Rewards Calculation. </b>The MVPs Earn Back Reward amount will be determined in accordance with the graduated percentages in Table 1.1 below. Each MVPs Level and the MVPs Earn Back Reward percentage earned are progressive, meaning the applicable percentage will only apply to the amount spent within the MVPs Level. Lowe’s will round partial cents to the nearest cent. It is possible for two percentages to be applied to one Qualifying Purchase for the purpose of calculating the Reward. By way of example only, if an Organization needed to accrue $50 in order to move up to a higher MVPs Level and a User spends $100 on a&nbsp;Qualifying Purchase, half of that Qualifying Purchase will be used to calculate MVPs Earn Back Rewards at the lower MVPs Level and half will be used to calculate MVPs Earn Back Rewards at the higher MVPs Level.</li></ul></ul><ul></ul><br><p></p><p></p><ul class="list-circle"></ul><p></p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="sc-1f1s622_engage-common-2 kNOjmZ"><div style="display:contents"><div class="u48kek_engage-common-1 ifPWIC"><div class="u48kek_engage-common-0 jzTRSr" data-techname="ScaledImage" data-businessname="na" data-componenttitle="Table 1.1" data-triggerimpression="false" data-trigger="false" data-isvisualizerbanner="false" data-gaugelinkid="A table showing M V Ps Rewards levels, qualifying purchase accrued spend and reward percentages." data-isSmartComponent="false"><h2 class="styles__H2-sc-11vpuyu-1 kwuyXg typography variant--h2 align--left" color="text_primary">Table 1.1</h2><div class="u48kek_engage-common-2 fqDxcz scaled-image-primary-link" data-linkid="A table showing M V Ps Rewards levels, qualifying purchase accrued spend and reward percentages." title="A table showing M V Ps Rewards levels, qualifying purchase accrued spend and reward percentages." data-promotype="" data-internalcampaignsvalue=""><noscript><span height="auto" width="100%" class="d7qutn_engage-common-1 hSRWND"><img src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0naHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmcnIHZpZXdCb3g9JzAgMCAzIDInPjwvc3ZnPg==" width="100%" height="auto" class="d7qutn_engage-common-0 ldZopE primary-image" alt="A table showing M V Ps Rewards levels, qualifying purchase accrued spend and reward percentages." title=""/></span></noscript><span class="d7qutn_engage-common-1 hSRWND lazy-load-image-background opacity" height="auto" width="100%"><picture><source media="(max-width: 35.9375rem)" type="image/webp" data-srcset="https://mobileimages.lowes.com/marketingimages/38120fe7-ccaf-4e4c-99e2-124ebb9e2d09/terms-and-conditions-table-1-1-v2.png?im=Resize,width=600&amp;fmt=webp"/><source media="(max-width: 35.9375rem)" type="image/jpeg" data-srcset="https://mobileimages.lowes.com/marketingimages/38120fe7-ccaf-4e4c-99e2-124ebb9e2d09/terms-and-conditions-table-1-1-v2.png?im=Resize,width=600"/><source media="(min-width: 36rem) and (max-width: 48rem)" type="image/webp" data-srcset="https://mobileimages.lowes.com/marketingimages/38120fe7-ccaf-4e4c-99e2-124ebb9e2d09/terms-and-conditions-table-1-1-v2.png?im=Resize,width=720&amp;fmt=webp"/><source media="(min-width: 36rem) and (max-width: 48rem)" type="image/jpeg" data-srcset="https://mobileimages.lowes.com/marketingimages/38120fe7-ccaf-4e4c-99e2-124ebb9e2d09/terms-and-conditions-table-1-1-v2.png?im=Resize,width=720"/><source media="(min-width: 48.0625rem)" type="image/webp" data-srcset="https://mobileimages.lowes.com/marketingimages/38120fe7-ccaf-4e4c-99e2-124ebb9e2d09/terms-and-conditions-table-1-1-v2.png?im=Resize,width=1053&amp;fmt=webp"/><source media="(min-width: 48.0625rem)" type="image/jpeg" data-srcset="https://mobileimages.lowes.com/marketingimages/38120fe7-ccaf-4e4c-99e2-124ebb9e2d09/terms-and-conditions-table-1-1-v2.png?im=Resize,width=1053"/><img data-srcset="" data-placeholder="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0naHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmcnIHZpZXdCb3g9JzAgMCAzIDInPjwvc3ZnPg==" width="100%" height="auto" class="d7qutn_engage-common-0 ldZopE primary-image" alt="A table showing M V Ps Rewards levels, qualifying purchase accrued spend and reward percentages." title=""/></picture></span></div></div></div></div></div><div class="sc-1f1s622_engage-common-2 kNOjmZ"><div style="display:contents"><div class="GridStyles__GridRow-sc-1ejksnu-1 qwBjG row sc-1t79ojw_engage-common-0 dJXoLs justify-center"><div class="GridStyles__GridColumn-sc-1ejksnu-2 jVtdnu col sc-1t79ojw_engage-common-1 exSWev sm-12 md-12 lg-12 xl-12"><div class="nvl2lw_engage-common-0 fmiIDq" data-techname="TextBlock" data-businessname="na" data-componenttitle="na" data-triggerimpression="false" data-trigger="false" data-gaugelinkid="&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;list-disc&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font"><h2 class="styles__H2-sc-11vpuyu-1 irzRON typography variant--h2 align--left section-header" color="text_primary"></h2><div data-linkid="&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;list-disc&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font" class="ifxsfn_engage-common-0 eWBThw"><p></p><ul class="list-disc"><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Legacy Paint Program Transition.</span> On March 7, 2022, Lowe’s For Pros Loyalty Paint Rewards Pilot Program members (“<span style="font-weight: bold;">Legacy Paint Members</span>”) will be transitioned to the MVPs Pro Paint Rewards program.

All available Rewards must be claimed by the end of each Program Period, except that any MVPs Earn Back Rewards or Paint Rewards earned from Qualifying Purchases or Paint Qualifying Purchases (as applicable) made in December may be claimed until January 15 of the following Program Period (or any other time frame as Lowe’s may determine in its sole discretion) by calling 1-844-LOW4PRO. Rewards do not roll over into any subsequent Program Periods. Any Rewards not claimed by the applicable deadline will be forfeited. Lowe’s reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to only offer Lowe’s E-Gift Cards in a minimum amount or in whole-dollar denominations, or as otherwise determined by Lowe’s. MVPs Earn Back Rewards or Paint Rewards can only be claimed in full, which means the Organization must claim the maximum amount of MVPs Earn Back Rewards or Paint Rewards available to it at the time of claiming. The maximum Lowe’s E-Gift Card that can be claimed at one time is $2,000. Any accrued reward balance above $2,000 can be claimed with additional E-Gift Card(s). Rewards may be subject to additional terms and will expire in accordance with the terms stated for that Reward. Determinations regarding claiming of Rewards are subject to Lowe’s sole and absolute discretion. Lowe’s E-Gift Cards do not expire.&nbsp;</li><ul class="list-circle"><li>The amount of claimed Rewards will be subtracted from the accrued reward balance associated with the Organization’s Account immediately when a Reward is requested based on the total Rewards dollars for the claimed Reward. For example, if the Organization has earned $25.30 in Rewards, the Organization must claim $25.30, which will be deducted from the Organization’s Account. In the event Lowe’s determines, in its sole and absolute discretion, that the Reward requested by that Primary Admin is unused and unavailable and the situation justifies restoration, the amount of such requested Reward will be restored to the Organization’s Account. Lowe’s reserves the right to limit the claiming of specific Rewards and to limit the number of Rewards available at any particular MVPs Level.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">MVPs Bonus Points Program.</span>&nbsp;Between July 11, 2022, and December 31, 2024 (unless we extend otherwise), Organizations will have the opportunity to earn and redeem bonus points (“<span style="font-weight: bold;">Bonus Points</span>”) through the Program. Bonus Points are automatically tracked at the time of the qualifying purchase, transaction or activity as defined by Lowe’s from time to time (“<span style="font-weight: bold;">Points Offers</span>” <span style="font-weight: bold;">or</span> “<span style="font-weight: bold;">Offerings</span>”).

Bonus Points for such Offerings will be awarded as described in the applicable offer and will be subject to any additional terms set forth within that offer.&nbsp;</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Redeeming Bonus Points for Reward Products or Rewards items.</span>&nbsp;Organizations may have the opportunity to redeem Bonus Points for certain items (<b>“Rewards items”</b> or <b>“Reward Products”</b>). To redeem Bonus Points for Rewards items or Reward Products, you must access the Bonus Rewards Center section on the App or online at <a href="https://www.lowes.com/account/mvp/loyalty-benefits?pageId=1" title="https://www.lowes.com/account/mvp/loyalty-benefits?pageId=1" target="_blank">MVPs Pro Rewards Program</a>&nbsp;to view Rewards items or Reward Products available for redemption, and then select to redeem an available Reward. Each Rewards items or Reward Products will indicate the amount of Bonus Points necessary for redemption. You must have enough Bonus Points available in your Lowe’s PRO Account (<b>“Available Points”</b>) for the Rewards items or Reward Products you wish to redeem. Bonus Points may only be redeemed for one Rewards Product per transaction and only by the Primary Admin of the Pro Account on behalf of the Organization. You may not redeem your Bonus Points for Rewards items or Reward Products in the same transaction in which the Bonus Points are accrued. Reward Products cannot be redeemed through any third-party platforms. All Rewards items or Reward Products are offers for a limited time, while supplies last, and provided on a first-come, first-served basis. Rewards items or Reward Products can only be redeemed for a limited time as set forth in the Rewards Center. Determinations regarding redemption of Bonus Points are subject to Lowe’s sole and absolute discretion. Lowe’s reserves the right to limit the redemption of specific Rewards items or Reward Products and limit the number of Rewards items or Reward Products available for redemption.</li><li>If your transaction for the redemption of Bonus Points for Rewards items or Reward Products within the Rewards Center is not completed in the same visit, the Rewards items or Reward Products will remain in your cart so long as the Reward Product is still available in the Rewards Center.&nbsp;</li><li>Bonus Points will be subtracted from the Organization’s Lowe’s Pro Account immediately when a Rewards items or Reward Products is redeemed. Bonus Points will be restored to a PRO Account only in the event Lowe’s determines, in its sole and absolute discretion, that the Rewards items or Reward Products requested are unavailable or cannot be delivered.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Attempts to redeem Bonus Points multiple times or through multiple users constitutes fraud and may result in the termination or suspension of your Lowe’s Pro Account. If you attempt to use Bonus Points more than once to redeem Rewards items or Reward Products, you may be terminated or suspended from the Bonus Points Program.&nbsp;</li><li>Upon redemption of a Rewards items or Reward Products, Lowe’s will ship the Rewards items or Reward Products to the address in the Organization’s Pro Account or an address provided by the Organization,&nbsp;unless otherwise indicated at the time of redemption.

Please review the details of the Rewards items or Reward Products to confirm whether any shipping and handling charges may apply.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Cancellation of Rewards items or Reward Products Redemption; Damaged Rewards items or Rewards Products.</span> Rewards Products cannot be returned and/or cancelled. Any attempt to cancel or return a Reward Product or Rewards item will not result in Bonus Points being added back to the Organization’s Pro Account. Rewards Products are limited in nature and Lowe’s cannot guarantee that we will be able to re-ship any Reward Products that you redeemed with your Bonus Points if the Reward Product arrives damaged.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Return of Purchases Earning Bonus Points.</span> If an Organization returns a purchased item, for which it has garnered Bonus Points, then Lowe’s reserves the right to deduct such Bonus Points from the Organization’s PRO Account. Please note that returning a purchased item may potentially result in a negative balance in your PRO Account. &nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Expiration of Bonus Points; Inactive Accounts.</span> An Organization will retain active status in the Program by participating in an Offering or redeeming Bonus Points within a Program Period (“Active”). An Organization will lose its Active status at the end of the Program Period if the Organization does not participate in a Points Offer or redeem Bonus Points within a Program Period (“Inactive”).&nbsp;</li><li>All unredeemed Bonus Points will expire upon (i) becoming an Inactive participant in the Program, (ii) the cancellation or termination of your Lowe’s Pro Account as described below, or (iii) the termination of the Bonus Points Program.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Whether a participant is Active or Inactive in the Program depends on whether the participant has participated in a Points Offer or redeemed Bonus Points during a Program Period as described in Table 1.3 below.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul></ul></ul><p></p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="sc-1f1s622_engage-common-2 kNOjmZ"><div style="display:contents"><div class="u48kek_engage-common-1 ifPWIC"><div class="u48kek_engage-common-0 jzTRSr" data-techname="ScaledImage" data-businessname="na" data-componenttitle="Table 1.3" data-triggerimpression="false" data-trigger="false" data-isvisualizerbanner="false" data-gaugelinkid="A table showing qualifying purchase accrued spend and reward percentage." data-isSmartComponent="false"><h2 class="styles__H2-sc-11vpuyu-1 kwuyXg typography variant--h2 align--left" color="text_primary">Table 1.3</h2><div class="u48kek_engage-common-2 fqDxcz scaled-image-primary-link" data-linkid="A table showing qualifying purchase accrued spend and reward percentage." title="A table showing qualifying purchase accrued spend and reward percentage." data-promotype="" data-internalcampaignsvalue=""><noscript><span height="auto" width="100%" class="d7qutn_engage-common-1 hSRWND"><img src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0naHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmcnIHZpZXdCb3g9JzAgMCAzIDInPjwvc3ZnPg==" width="100%" height="auto" class="d7qutn_engage-common-0 ldZopE primary-image" alt="A table showing qualifying purchase accrued spend and reward percentage." title=""/></span></noscript><span class="d7qutn_engage-common-1 hSRWND lazy-load-image-background opacity" height="auto" width="100%"><picture><source media="(max-width: 35.9375rem)" type="image/webp" data-srcset="https://mobileimages.lowes.com/marketingimages/e903a479-ad1b-403c-ab78-698336bda37e/bonus-point-activity-table-MOW.png?im=Resize,width=600&amp;fmt=webp"/><source media="(max-width: 35.9375rem)" type="image/jpeg" data-srcset="https://mobileimages.lowes.com/marketingimages/e903a479-ad1b-403c-ab78-698336bda37e/bonus-point-activity-table-MOW.png?im=Resize,width=600"/><source media="(min-width: 36rem) and (max-width: 48rem)" type="image/webp" data-srcset="https://mobileimages.lowes.com/marketingimages/aa6ad683-9e43-4dc4-91e4-a5cde7a89020/bonus-point-activity-table.png?im=Resize,width=720&amp;fmt=webp"/><source media="(min-width: 36rem) and (max-width: 48rem)" type="image/jpeg" data-srcset="https://mobileimages.lowes.com/marketingimages/aa6ad683-9e43-4dc4-91e4-a5cde7a89020/bonus-point-activity-table.png?im=Resize,width=720"/><source media="(min-width: 48.0625rem)" type="image/webp" data-srcset="https://mobileimages.lowes.com/marketingimages/aa6ad683-9e43-4dc4-91e4-a5cde7a89020/bonus-point-activity-table.png?im=Resize,width=1053&amp;fmt=webp"/><source media="(min-width: 48.0625rem)" type="image/jpeg" data-srcset="https://mobileimages.lowes.com/marketingimages/aa6ad683-9e43-4dc4-91e4-a5cde7a89020/bonus-point-activity-table.png?im=Resize,width=1053"/><img data-srcset="" data-placeholder="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0naHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmcnIHZpZXdCb3g9JzAgMCAzIDInPjwvc3ZnPg==" width="100%" height="auto" class="d7qutn_engage-common-0 ldZopE primary-image" alt="A table showing qualifying purchase accrued spend and reward percentage." title=""/></picture></span></div></div></div></div></div><div class="sc-1f1s622_engage-common-2 kNOjmZ"><div style="display:contents"><div class="GridStyles__GridRow-sc-1ejksnu-1 qwBjG row sc-1t79ojw_engage-common-0 dJXoLs justify-center"><div class="GridStyles__GridColumn-sc-1ejksnu-2 jVtdnu col sc-1t79ojw_engage-common-1 exSWev sm-12 md-12 lg-12 xl-12"><div class="nvl2lw_engage-common-0 fmiIDq" data-techname="TextBlock" data-businessname="na" data-componenttitle="na" data-triggerimpression="false" data-trigger="false" data-gaugelinkid="&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;list-disc&quot;&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;lis"><h2 class="styles__H2-sc-11vpuyu-1 irzRON typography variant--h2 align--left section-header" color="text_primary" id=""></h2><div data-linkid="&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;list-disc&quot;&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;lis" class="ifxsfn_engage-common-0 eWBThw"><p></p><p></p><ul class="list-disc"><ul class="list-circle"><ul class="list-circle"><li><b>Illustration:&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;</li><ul class="list-disc"><li>An Organization participates in a Points Offer and/or redeems its Bonus Points in 2022, 2023 and 2024.

Government health care and education Organizations, GPO Parent Organizations, and other ineligible Organizations are ineligible to participate in Sweepstakes. If your Organization does not want to participate in the Sweepstakes, you can opt out of participating in the Sweepstakes or reject the prize.

VSP is only available on lowes.com to Organizations in the Silver MVP and above (e.g., Gold, Platinum) MVPs Levels. To receive VSP pricing online, you must be logged in to your Account on Lowes.com, save a PRO Quote, and proceed to checkout. Organizations will see the total VSP discount on the quote details and checkout screens online. No retroactive discounts will be given on purchases where you were not logged in to your Organization’s Account either to request a quote or prior to purchase. VSP pricing may not be combined with any other promotion or coupon and does not apply to prior purchases.

Attempts to claim single-use offers and verification codes for Rewards multiple times or through multiple users constitute fraud and may result in the termination or suspension of your PRO Account. Lowe’s further reserves the right to refuse delivery of any orders, including those placed through a PRO Account, if Lowe’s believes that a User has violated or acted inconsistently with these PRO Terms or applicable law or acted in a manner harmful to Lowe’s interests, or may be likely to do so based upon prior communications, conduct, interactions or similar factors.</li></ul><p></p><p></p><ul class="list-circle"><ul class="list-circle"><li>Upon cancellation or termination for any reason, the canceled PRO Account shall immediately cease, and it may no longer receive Rewards.

Each Status provides MLR Members with access to unique MyLowe’s Rewards Program benefits and offers, including lower spend threshold to receive free shipping, as discussed in detail below. Lowe’s in its sole discretion, may provide certain MLR Members with Silver Key Status based on criteria other than cumulative, accrued spend on Eligible Purchases. In such instances, these customers must still meet the accrued spend threshold in \u003cspan style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Table 2.2\u003c/span> to achieve the next Status.

If a MLR Member does not make enough Eligible Purchases by the end of a given MyLowe’s Rewards Program Period to maintain the MyLowe’s Rewards Status reached the previous MyLowe’s Reward Program Period, then the MLR Member will begin the subsequent Program Period at the lower MyLowe’s Rewards Status that corresponds to the MLR Member’s actual accrued spend from Eligible Purchases made in the preceding MyLowe’s Rewards Program Period. A MLR Member’s Eligible Purchase accrued spend will reset to zero at the beginning of each new MyLowe’s Rewards Program Period. Lowe’s reserves the right to change, modify or update the requirements needed to earn each MyLowe’s Rewards Status (including, without limitation, the minimum amount of accrued spend required) and determine a MLR Member’s starting MyLowe’s Rewards Status for any MyLowe’s Rewards Program Period in its sole discretion.\u003cbr>\u003cbr>\u003c/li>\u003cli>\u003cb>Lower Threshold for Free Standard Shipping Benefit (Not Available in AK &amp; HI).\u003c/b> MLR Members may receive free standard shipping on eligible purchases if they meet a minimum purchase threshold.

MVPs Levels and Rewards may not be gifted, purchased, sold, bartered, brokered or otherwise transferred, except that the Program may allow a Primary Admin on behalf of the Organization to allocate certain Rewards in certain limited instances as described below. Rewards available via the MVPs Program have no cash value, are purely promotional and do not constitute property of any User or Organization (as applicable). No portion of any payment for purchases qualifying for the Program or any MVPs Level, Member Benefits or Rewards constitutes consideration paid for the Program or any MVPs Level or Rewards. Lowe’s reserves the right in its sole discretion to limit the claiming or redemption of specific Rewards and to limit the number of MVPs Levels and Rewards available.\u003c/li>\u003c/ul>\u003c/ul>\u003cul class=\"list-disc\">\u003cli>\u003cb style=\"background-color: transparent;\">MVPs Pro Rewards Program Periods.\u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"background-color: transparent;\"> Participation in the Program is based on consecutive Program Periods, starting in the year in which an Organization joins the MVPs Pro Rewards Program. The initial Program Period is effective from Jan. 7, 2022 to Dec. 31, 2022. Each subsequent Program Period will begin on January 1 of the applicable calendar year.\u003c/span>\u003c/li>\u003cli>At the end of each Program Period, all unclaimed Rewards and Member Benefits will be forfeited, subject to the exclusions set forth below.

Government customers and cooperative purchasing programs, including GPOs Parent Organizations, are not eligible for the Program. Resellers are expressly excluded from the MVPs Pro Rewards Program. Commercial customers with a National Account contract are not eligible for MVPs Earn Back Rewards.\u003c/span>\u003c/li>\u003cli>\u003cb>MVPs Pro Rewards Program Qualifying Purchases.\u003c/b>&nbsp;Qualifying purchases include net completed purchases of qualifying products as further detailed below and subject to the exclusions below (“Qualifying&nbsp;Purchases”). “Completed purchases” means the transaction has been settled and fulfilled and the transaction appears on the Organization’s Account purchase history. Qualifying Purchases are PRO Tracked Purchases calculated based on the actual amount paid on any completed purchases of products made by the Organization during the Program Period after any allowable discounts are applied, if any, and excluding: labor services and special fees; warranty; Lowe’s Protection Plans; shipping and handling; delivery; surcharges; service fees; sales and use taxes; and product fees. Qualifying Purchases do not include: (i) purchases of electrical cable and electrical wires; (ii) purchases of Lowe’s Gift Cards or Gift Certificates or other third-party Gift Cards or Gift Certificates; (iii) purchases made using an employee discount (iv) purchases or transactions made with Rewards or other promotional items (such as free items), whether made in store, online or through the Lowe’s app; (v) government purchases; (vi) purchases made for personal use, including any purchase using a Personal Account or Military Discount; or (vii) purchases made on tender previously registered by another Organization. In addition, any purchase of Paint (as defined below) will be a Qualifying Purchase only for the purposes of determining MVPs Level but will not be a Qualifying Purchase for purposes of calculating MVPs Earn Back Rewards.\u003c/li>\u003c/ul>\u003cul>\u003cul class=\"list-disc\">\u003cli>If an item from a Qualifying Purchase is returned, the return amount will be deducted from Qualifying Purchase spend toward earning Rewards. If the item is returned after a Reward has been issued, your Account may reflect a negative balance.\u003c/li>\u003cli>For a new PRO Account, once your Account is created, Lowe’s will recognize any Qualifying Purchase made online while logged into your Account and any Qualifying Purchase made in store while using Registered Tender or Member ID.\u003c/li>\u003cli>Qualifying Purchases made between the date of confirmed MVPs Earn Back Rewards eligibility and 12/31/22 will count toward the MVPs Earn Back Rewards calculation as defined below.\u003c/li>\u003c/ul>\u003c/ul>\u003cul class=\"list-disc\">\u003cli>\u003cb>MVPs Levels. \u003c/b>Each Organization can reach one or more MVPs Levels: MVPs, Silver MVPs, Gold MVPs, Platinum MVPs (each, an “\u003cb>MVPs Level\u003c/b>”) based on the accrued spend within a given Program Period from that Organization’s Users’ Qualifying Purchases. Details regarding the MVPs Levels are available through the \u003ca href=\"/l/Pro/pro-benefits\" title=\"/l/Pro/pro-benefits\">MVPs Pro Rewards Program page\u003c/a>. Upon joining the Program, an Organization will be placed in the lowest MVPs Level. As an Organization’s Users make Qualifying Purchases during the applicable Program Period, the Organization may move up into one or more MVPs Levels based on the Organization’s Users’ accrued spend. The Organization will remain in its starting MVPs Level through that Program Period unless and until its Users’ accrued spend on Qualifying Purchases in that same Program Period moves the Organization up into a higher MVPs Level. The highest MVPs Level reached from accrued spend on Qualifying Purchases during a given Program Period will be that Organization’s starting MVPs Level for the subsequent Program Period. If an Organization does not make enough Qualifying Purchases in a given Program Period to maintain its MVPs Level for the subsequent Program Period, the Organization will begin the subsequent Program Period at the lower MVPs Level corresponding to its accrued spend from Qualifying Purchases in that preceding Program Period. Lowe’s reserves the right to change, modify or update the requirements needed to earn each MVPs Level status (including, without limitation, the minimum amount of accrued spend required), Rewards and/or Member Benefits and determine your starting MVPs Level for any Program Period in its sole discretion.\u003c/li>\u003c/ul>\u003cul>\u003cul class=\"list-circle\">\u003cli>\u003cb>Summary.\u003c/b>\u003c/li>\u003c/ul>\u003c/ul>\u003cul class=\"list-circle\">\u003cul class=\"list-circle\">\u003cul>\u003cul class=\"list-disc\">\u003cli>Each Program Period is one year.\u003c/li>\u003cli>Users’ accrued spend on Qualifying Purchases during a given Program Period determines which MVPs Level the Organization is in for that Program Period. Users’ accrued spend resets to zero at the start of each Program Period.\u003c/li>\u003cli>The MVPs Level the Organization is in at the end of a given Program Period will be the MVPs Level at which the Organization begins the subsequent Program Period, but the Organization can move up into a higher MVPs Level based on Users’ accrued spend in that subsequent Program Period.\u003c/li>\u003cli>Organizations do not move down into a lower MVPs Level within the same Program Period. However, an Organization will begin a subsequent Program Period at a lower MVPs Level if the Organization’s Users’ accrued spend on Qualifying Purchases within the immediately preceding Program Period do not meet the minimum amount required to maintain the same MVPs Level.\u003c/li>\u003c/ul>\u003c/ul>\u003c/ul>\u003cli>\u003cb style=\"background-color: transparent;\">MVPs Earn Back Rewards.\u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"background-color: transparent;\">&nbsp;“\u003c/span>\u003cb style=\"background-color: transparent;\">MVPs Earn Back Rewards\u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"background-color: transparent;\">” will be calculated as a percentage of the accrued spend from Qualifying Purchases made during a Program Period by the Organization’s Users, and the Organization’s accrued reward balance will be available to the Primary Admin in the Organization’s Pro Account. MVPs Earn Back Rewards will be issued in the form of electronic Lowe’s Gift Cards (\u003c/span>\u003cb style=\"background-color: transparent;\">“Lowe’s E-Gift Card”\u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"background-color: transparent;\"> or \u003c/span>\u003cb style=\"background-color: transparent;\">“E-Gift Card”\u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"background-color: transparent;\">) that will appear in the Primary Admin’s Wallet once the accrued reward balance is claimed as an E-Gift Card by the Primary Admin on behalf of the Organization. The percentage is determined by the Organization’s MVPs Level at the time the Qualifying Purchase was made, except if the amount spent on a specific Qualifying Purchase would result in the Organization moving up to a higher MVPs Level, in which case the percentage will be calculated on a pro rata basis (see example below). Only PRO Tracked Purchases will count toward MVPs Earn Back Rewards calculation or MVPs Level determination (i.e., purchases made without using Registered Tender, Member ID or while not signed in to your PRO Account will not count). Paint Qualifying Purchases (as defined below) will not count toward MVPs Earn Back Rewards calculation.\u003c/span>\u003cbr>\u003c/li>\u003cul class=\"list-circle\">\u003cli>\u003cb>MVPs Earn Back Rewards Calculation. \u003c/b>The MVPs Earn Back Reward amount will be determined in accordance with the graduated percentages in Table 1.1 below. Each MVPs Level and the MVPs Earn Back Reward percentage earned are progressive, meaning the applicable percentage will only apply to the amount spent within the MVPs Level. Lowe’s will round partial cents to the nearest cent. It is possible for two percentages to be applied to one Qualifying Purchase for the purpose of calculating the Reward. By way of example only, if an Organization needed to accrue $50 in order to move up to a higher MVPs Level and a User spends $100 on a&nbsp;Qualifying Purchase, half of that Qualifying Purchase will be used to calculate MVPs Earn Back Rewards at the lower MVPs Level and half will be used to calculate MVPs Earn Back Rewards at the higher MVPs Level.\u003c/li>\u003c/ul>\u003c/ul>\u003cul>\u003c/ul>\u003cbr>\u003cp>\u003c/p>\u003cp>\u003c/p>\u003cul class=\"list-circle\">\u003c/ul>\u003cp>\u003c/p>"},"decodedHTML":"\u003ch2>\u003cspan style=\"font-size: unset; background-color: transparent;\">\u003c/span>\u003c/h2>\u003ch2>\u003c/h2>\u003ch2>\u003c/h2>\u003cp>\u003cb style=\"font-size: unset; background-color: transparent;\">PRO Account Specific Benefits. \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-size: unset; background-color: transparent;\">A PRO Account may be required to obtain and use certain site features, programs and benefits, including but not limited to the MVPs Pro Rewards & Partnership Program, Bulk Purchasing, and Pro Exclusive Pricing.

Organizations are placed in MVPs Levels (as defined below) based on their Users’ accrued spend, and the MVPs Levels determine the level of Rewards an Organization earns, as more fully described below. For more information on MVPs Levels, Rewards and Program features and experiences, please visit the \u003ca href=\"https://www.lowes.com/Pro\">MVPs Pro Rewards Program page.\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\u003c/ul>\u003cul>\u003cul class=\"list-circle\">\u003cli>There is no fee associated with the Program. Your participation in the Program is unique to the Organization under which you are registered for the Program. MVPs Levels and Rewards may not be gifted, purchased, sold, bartered, brokered or otherwise transferred, except that the Program may allow a Primary Admin on behalf of the Organization to allocate certain Rewards in certain limited instances as described below. Rewards available via the MVPs Program have no cash value, are purely promotional and do not constitute property of any User or Organization (as applicable). No portion of any payment for purchases qualifying for the Program or any MVPs Level, Member Benefits or Rewards constitutes consideration paid for the Program or any MVPs Level or Rewards.

Qualifying Purchases are PRO Tracked Purchases calculated based on the actual amount paid on any completed purchases of products made by the Organization during the Program Period after any allowable discounts are applied, if any, and excluding: labor services and special fees; warranty; Lowe’s Protection Plans; shipping and handling; delivery; surcharges; service fees; sales and use taxes; and product fees. Qualifying Purchases do not include: (i) purchases of electrical cable and electrical wires; (ii) purchases of Lowe’s Gift Cards or Gift Certificates or other third-party Gift Cards or Gift Certificates; (iii) purchases made using an employee discount (iv) purchases or transactions made with Rewards or other promotional items (such as free items), whether made in store, online or through the Lowe’s app; (v) government purchases; (vi) purchases made for personal use, including any purchase using a Personal Account or Military Discount; or (vii) purchases made on tender previously registered by another Organization.

Details regarding the MVPs Levels are available through the \u003ca href=\"/l/Pro/pro-benefits\" title=\"/l/Pro/pro-benefits\">MVPs Pro Rewards Program page\u003c/a>. Upon joining the Program, an Organization will be placed in the lowest MVPs Level. As an Organization’s Users make Qualifying Purchases during the applicable Program Period, the Organization may move up into one or more MVPs Levels based on the Organization’s Users’ accrued spend. The Organization will remain in its starting MVPs Level through that Program Period unless and until its Users’ accrued spend on Qualifying Purchases in that same Program Period moves the Organization up into a higher MVPs Level. The highest MVPs Level reached from accrued spend on Qualifying Purchases during a given Program Period will be that Organization’s starting MVPs Level for the subsequent Program Period. If an Organization does not make enough Qualifying Purchases in a given Program Period to maintain its MVPs Level for the subsequent Program Period, the Organization will begin the subsequent Program Period at the lower MVPs Level corresponding to its accrued spend from Qualifying Purchases in that preceding Program Period.

The percentage is determined by the Organization’s MVPs Level at the time the Qualifying Purchase was made, except if the amount spent on a specific Qualifying Purchase would result in the Organization moving up to a higher MVPs Level, in which case the percentage will be calculated on a pro rata basis (see example below). Only PRO Tracked Purchases will count toward MVPs Earn Back Rewards calculation or MVPs Level determination (i.e., purchases made without using Registered Tender, Member ID or while not signed in to your PRO Account will not count).
