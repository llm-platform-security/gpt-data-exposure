<p>Please note that we do not &quot;sell&quot; or &quot;share&quot; Personal Information for the purpose of cross-contextual behavioral advertising, as those terms are understood under relevant local laws. Moreover, we do not process sensitive Personal Information with the intent to deduce certain attributes about a consumer.</p>
<p><strong>Rights Exercise.</strong> Where local legislation allows, the privacy rights outlined in this section can be exercised by submitting a request to <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c2aea7a5a3ae82b2b7a7b0b1a3ecaeb6a6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="a8c4cdcfc9c4e8d8ddcddadbc986c4dccc">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.</p>
<p><strong>Authentication.</strong> To prevent illicit access, alteration, or removal of your Personal Information, we may necessitate that you verify your identity prior to submitting a request for knowledge, correction, or deletion of Personal Information. Should you not have an account with us, or if suspicious activity is detected, we might request additional Personal Information and residency proof for authentication. Should we fail to authenticate your identity, we will be unable to fulfill your request.</p>
<p><strong>Approved Representatives.</strong> A request for rights can also be submitted through an approved representative. In such instances, the representative must provide signed written consent to act in your stead and you may be asked to verify your identity and provide residency proof independently. Requests from approved representatives can be submitted to <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#224e4745434e625257475051430c4e5646" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="bfd3dad8ded3ffcfcadacdccde91d3cbdb">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.</p>
<p><strong>Contesting Decisions.</strong> Your place of residence may grant you the right to contest a decision we make in response to requests to exercise your rights as per local legislation. To contest a decision, please forward your request to <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d5b9b0b2b4b995a5a0b0a7a6b4fbb9a1b1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="e8848d8f8984a8989d8d9a9b89c6849c8c">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.</p>

<p>We employ reasonable commercial standards of technical, administrative, and organizational measures to safeguard Personal Information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction, both online and offline. Nevertheless, no online or email transmission is completely secure or error-free. Emails sent to or received from us may not be secure. As such, we advise careful consideration of what information you send to us via the Service or email. Furthermore, we cannot be held accountable for any circumvention of privacy settings or security measures on the Service, or third-party websites.</p>
<p>We retain your Personal Information only as long as necessary to provide our Service to you, or for other valid business reasons like resolving disputes, ensuring safety and security, or meeting our legal obligations. The retention duration of Personal Information depends on several factors, such as the quantity, type, and sensitivity of the data, potential risk from unauthorized use or disclosure, our reasons for processing the data, and legal requirements.</p>
