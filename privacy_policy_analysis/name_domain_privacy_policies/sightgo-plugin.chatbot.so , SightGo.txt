            <b>Privacy Policy</b>
        </h2>
        <p>
            This Privacy Policy describes how the SightGo Plugin for ChatGPT ("we", "our", "us") collects, uses, and discloses your information.
        </p>
        <h2>
            1. Information We Collect
        </h2>
        <p>
            Our plugin does not collect any personal data from users. All we require is the address provided by the user to fetch a street view image, which is not stored after the session ends.
        </p>
        <h2>
            2. Use of Information
        </h2>
        <p>
            The address information provided by users is utilized solely for the purpose of retrieving a street view image to provide a visual representation of the desired location.
        </p>
        <h2>
            3. Information Sharing
        </h2>
        <p>
            Since we do not store personal data, we do not share any such data with third parties.
        </p>
        <h2>

        </h2>
        <p>
            We reserve the right to update this Privacy Policy at any time. Any changes will be posted on this page.
