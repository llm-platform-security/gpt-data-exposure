</ul>
<h2>SECTION 3. ACCEPTANCE OF THE TERMS OF USE</h2>
<p>The use of the features of the Platform and the Services implies the acceptance of these Terms of Use.</p>
<p>Thus, the User must read these Terms of Use carefully when accessing the Platform and is invited to download, print and keep a copy.</p>
<p>These ToU are available at the bottom of each page of the Platform <em>via</em> a hypertext link and can thus be read at any time.</p>
<h2>SECTION 4. TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS</h2>
<p>By using the Platform, the User acknowledges that they have the necessary means and skills to use the features offered on the Platform.</p>
<p>The equipment required to access and use the Platform is at the User's expense, as are any telecommunications costs incurred by its use.</p>
<h2>SECTION 5. ROLE OF THE OPERATOR</h2>
<h3>Section 5.1. Content of NUMISTA’s intervention</h3>
<p>NUMISTA can play two distinct roles on the Platform:</p>
<h4>Section 5.1.1. Intervention as a simple intermediary</h4>
<p>The Platform published by NUMISTA proposes a matchmaking service, by electronic means, to the Collectors allowing them in particular to exchange Collector's Items.</p>
<p>NUMISTA has no control over the execution of the exchange of Collectibles and does not intervene in the relationship between the Collectors.</p>
<p>The Registrations of Collectibles are established by the Collectors.</p>
<p>NUMISTA is paid by advertising and through a Premium Subscription offered to Users, whose subscription is governed by the Terms and Conditions of Subscription.</p>
<p>When you click on links to various merchants on the Platform and make a purchase, this can result in NUMISTA earning a commission. Affiliate programs and affiliations include, but are not limited to, the eBay Partner Network.</p>
<h4>Section 5.1.2. Intervention as a service provider</h4>
<p>NUMISTA also proposes directly on the Platform other Services for Collectors.</p>
<h3>Section 5.2. General pre-contractual information obligation: fairness, clarity and transparency</h3>
<h4>Section 5.2.1. General provisions</h4>
<p>As an online platform operator, NUMISTA acts in a neutral, clear and transparent way.</p>
<p>NUMISTA does not have any capital link or any legal dependence with one of the Collectors referenced on the Platform which would influence the classification or the referencing of the Collectibles.</p>
<p>The Collectibles and, more precisely, the Catalogue Pages are presented to internet users on the Platform according to the User's choice:</p>
<p>The default sorting is as follows: by country of issue (alphabetical order), by quotation (chronological order), by face value, by date, by commemorated event and by title.</p>
<p>On each Catalogue Page, an extract of the list of Collectors offering this type of Collectible Object is presented in random order. It is possible to access the details by year of issue. For each year of issue, the Collectors are displayed in random order.</p>
<p>On the page that displays all Active Collectors who offer Collectibles for trade:</p>
<p>The default sorting is random, but it is possible to sort by alphabetical order of the User's name, by rating following the evaluations of the Swaps, by country, by number of Collectibles offered by the Collectors and which could be of interest to the User (according to the defined wishes), the number of Collectibles offered for Swap by the User and which could interest the Collector (according to the defined wishes), by date of registration on the Platform, and by distance (according to the location provided by the Collector and that of the User).</p>
<p>It is specified that Collectors who meet one of these criteria are never listed on the Platform:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A Collector who has indicated in the configuration of their Account that they do not wish to trade;</li>
    <li>A Collector who has an average rating of 2.5 / 5 or less;</li>
    <li>A Collector who has a warning on their profile as described in section 8.2.4 of these ToU;</li>
    <li>A Collector who has not logged into their Account in the last 365 days.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the number of unique monthly visitors on the Platform is greater than five million, NUMISTA will publish a charter of good practices that it undertakes to respect as an online platform operator.</p>
<h4>Section 5.2.2. Financial transparency</h4>
<p>In accordance with Section 242 bis of the French General Tax Code, NUMISTA must, at the time of each transaction carried out by its intermediary, communicate to the Collectors, fair, clear and transparent information on the tax and social obligations which fall to them. Appendix 1 of these Terms of Use specifies these obligations by referring to the French administration's websites to comply with them.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Where applicable, in January of each year, provide each Collector with a summary document of transactions and the overall turnover achieved by the Collector through the Platform during the previous year.</li>
    <li>Where applicable, before 31 January of the year following the year for which the information is provided, send the French tax authorities a summary containing the information provided in the summary document sent to each Collector. The Collector is informed that NUMISTA will be required to communicate to the tax authorities the following information:
        <ul>
            <li>The number and total gross amount of transactions made by the User during the previous calendar year, indicating the amount of transactions taxable in France separately;</li>
            <li>If known by the Operator, the details of the bank account to which the User's income is paid.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>SECTION 6. ONLINE REVIEWS</h2>
<p>Once an agreement has been reached with a Collector, the other Collector can leave a review of their exchange experience.</p>
<p>The Collector will be able to indicate a rating between 0 and 5 stars and post a comment.</p>
<p>The review will be visible on the rated Collector's profile page.</p>
<p>If the rating is less than 5 stars, the rated Collector may post a response below the rating.</p>
<p>In addition, the Collector may also rate an outing by indicating a title, a rating and a comment within the dedicated tab of the Platform.</p>
<p>As part of the publication of online reviews carried out on the Platform, the Operator hereby expressly undertakes to provide Users with fair, clear and transparent information on the methods of publication and processing of online reviews. In this respect, NUMISTA undertakes to display the date of the notice and any updates.</p>
<p>In case of control of the reviews, the Operator undertakes to ensure that the processing of personal data carried out within this framework complies with the French Data Protection Act No. 78-17 of 6 January 1978 (“<em>loi informatique et libertés</em>”), as amended, and the GDPR.</p>
<p>No compensation is provided by NUMISTA in exchange for the publication of a Collector's review.</p>
<p>The maximum period of publication of a review is 365 days.</p>
<p>The maximum period of retention of a review on the Platform is 3650 days.</p>
<p>Finally, NUMISTA provides a free feature that allows any User to report a problem in a review, by sending an email to <a href="mailto:contact@numista.com">contact@numista.com</a>.
</p>
<p><em>A posteriori</em>, and in case of a relevant report, NUMISTA undertakes to remove a review if it:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Does not comply with these Terms of Use;</li>
    <li>Contains abusive, defamatory, racist or illegal content.</li>
</ul>
<p>The reviews can be modified at the request of the author of the review. In this respect, the author shall contact the Operator by private message on the Platform in order to request the modification.</p>
<h2>SECTION 7. COLLECTOR ACCESS AND ACCOUNT CREATION CONDITIONS</h2>
<p>Any User can access the Platform and benefit from the Services described in section 8.1 of these ToU.</p>
<p>In order to benefit from all the Services offered on the Platform and to be able to trade with other Collectors, the User must first create an Account to become a Collector.</p>
<p>Account creation on the Platform as a Collector is free.</p>
<p>To create an Account, the User is invited to click on the &quot;Register&quot; button and to complete all the required information. The Username and the password chosen will constitute the Identifiers.</p>
<p>The User wishing to become a Collector must provide the Operator with accurate, fair and up-to-date data, which does not infringe, in any way whatsoever, the rights of third parties and communicate to the Operator any necessary update of the data communicated upon Account creation.</p>
<p>Finally, the User shall validate these ToU before finalising their account creation.</p>
<p>The Collector will then receive a confirmation email allowing them to activate their Account.</p>
<p>The Collector agrees to create only one Account on the Platform. The Operator will not be liable in any way for the harmful consequences that could result from the use of multiple Accounts for a single Collector.</p>
<p>The User is entirely responsible for the accuracy and updating of the data communicated in the context of the opening and management of their Account.</p>
<h3>Section 7.1. Identifiers</h3>
<p>The Collector shall be solely liable for the use of their Identifiers or actions taken through their Account.</p>
<p>In the event that a Collector discloses or uses their Identifiers in a manner contrary to their intended purpose, the Operator may suspend the Account.</p>
<p>Under no circumstances shall NUMISTA be held liable in case of theft of a Collector's identity. Any access and action carried out from a Collector's Account will be presumed to be carried out by this Collector, insofar as the Operator is not obliged to and does not have the technical means to ensure the identity of persons accessing the Platform from an Account.</p>
<p>Any loss, misappropriation, or unauthorised use of a Collector's Identifiers and their consequences are the sole responsibility of the User, who is required to notify NUMISTA, without delay, by email sent to the following address: <a href="mailto:contact@numista.com">contact@numista.com</a>.</p>
<h3>Section 7.2. Unsubscribing</h3>
<p>The Collector may close their Account at any time. The Collector must connect to their Account, click on &quot;Settings&quot;, and then on &quot;Close my account&quot;.</p>
<p>The Account will be immediately deactivated.</p>
<h2>SECTION 8. SERVICES</h2>
<h3>Section 8.1. Services offered to all Internet users</h3>
<p>Without being registered on the Platform, any internet user can benefit from the following Services:</p>
<h4>Section 8.1.1. Consulting the Catalogue</h4>
<p>From the Platform, the internet user can consult the Catalogue of coins and banknotes proposed on the Platform by Collectors.</p>
<p>To narrow its search, the internet user can filter the results of the Catalogue Pages and choose only certain categories (continent, period).</p>
<p>The internet user can also add criteria to its search (e.g., type, reference, vintage, weight, diameter or length/width, inscription, etc.) or view Collectibles recently added to the Catalogue.</p>
<p>Users may view Collectibles.</p>
<h4>Section 8.1.2. Viewing Collector Registrations</h4>
<p>Users may view Collector Registrations.</p>
<p>More precisely, the Collectibles offered for exchange on the Platform are visible either on the list of Collectibles of each Collector, this list being accessible from their profile and from the &quot;Swaps&quot; page, or on the list of Collectibles offered for exchange for a given type of coin or banknote, accessible from the Catalogue Page describing this type of coin or banknote.</p>
<h4>Section 8.1.3. Consulting the forum</h4>
<p>By clicking on the &quot;Forum&quot; tab, internet users can consult the messages published on the Platform's forum but will not be able to reply to them without having an Account.</p>

<p>By clicking on the &quot;Outings&quot; tab, any Internet user can access the numismatic outings identified. They can also customise their search according to the place, dates and type of outing (fair, expo, shop, market, museum, auction, and Numista outing).</p>
<p>To report an outing, the user must have an Account on the Platform.</p>
<h3>Section 8.2. Services offered to any Collector with an Account on the Platform</h3>
<p>In addition to the Services available to any internet user, any Collector registered on the Platform will have access to the following additional Services:</p>
<h4>Section 8.2.1. Addition of Pages to the Catalogue</h4>
<p>The Collector can create Catalogue Pages describing the types of coins and banknotes for encyclopaedic purposes.</p>
<p>The Catalogue Pages will be checked by an Administrator in order to verify the accuracy of the data by crossing the information with various numismatic sources. The Administrator also enforces the recommendations of modification of the Catalogue.</p>
<p>For more details, the User is invited to consult the following page: <a href="https://en.numista.com/help/guidelines-for-the-numista-catalogue-141.html">https://en.numista.com/help/guidelines-for-the-numista-catalogue-141.html</a>.</p>
<h4>Section 8.2.2. Registration of the collection</h4>
<p>Any Collector may enter their collection of Collectibles into the Platform.</p>
<p>The Collector may associate each Registration with a Catalogue Page and complete it with additional information about the Collectible (condition, commentary, availability for exchange etc.)</p>
<p>For more details, the Collector can consult the page accessible at the following address: <a href="https://en.numista.com/help/how-can-i-register-my-collection-on-numista-1.html">https://en.numista.com/help/how-can-i-register-my-collection-on-numista-1.html</a>.</p>
<p>The Collector must complete the form to request the addition of a coin or banknote and create or modify a previous Registration.</p>
<p>The photographs of the Collectibles may come either from the Collector themselves, who may indicate their name in the credit line under the photograph, or from NUMISTA's partners who authorise the Collector to reuse said photographs free of charge on the Platform. In this second case, the Collector will select the website of origin, which will result in the display of a link under the photograph.</p>
<p>The Administrators do not validate the Registrations made by the Collectors.</p>
<p>The Collector's coins and/or banknotes must be entered in order to proceed with Swaps.</p>
<h4>Section 8.2.3. Management of the collection</h4>
<p>In accordance with Section 8.2.2. hereof, the Collector may register their Collectibles on the Platform and specify the type of coin or banknote, the condition, photographs and comments. There is no limit to the number of Collectibles that may be added to the Platform by each Collector.</p>
<p>Thus, the Collector has the possibility to manage their collection by keeping the inventories accessible online and by storing their comments and photographs. The photographs are limited to a total of 500 Mb. By subscribing, the Collector will have more storage space.</p>
<p>The Collector may at any time consult their collection of Collectible Items using the &quot;My coins&quot;, &quot;My banknotes&quot; and &quot;My exonumia&quot; links accessible on their Account. Only applicable links are displayed. If the Collector has not saved any coins or banknotes, only the &quot;My coins&quot; link will be displayed.</p>
<p>The Collector can also view a dashboard with various statistics and data on their collection and export this information in an Excel document.</p>
<h4>Section 8.2.4. Swaps of Collectibles</h4>
<h5>General provisions</h5>
<p>Through the Platform, NUMISTA puts Collectors in contact with each other in order to carry out exchanges.</p>
<p class="warning_box">Collectors are reminded that <strong>presenting oneself as a consumer while acting in the context of a regular or usual professional activity may be considered as a misleading commercial practice</strong> punishable by 2-year imprisonment and a fine of 300 000 euros.
    <br />The amount of the fine may be increased in proportion to the benefits derived from the offence, to 10% of the average annual turnover, calculated on the last three known annual turnovers at the date of the facts or to 50% of the expenses incurred for the implementation of an advertisement or the practice constituting this offence
    <br />(<em>Section L.132-2 of the French Consumer Code</em>)</p>
<p>Any Collector has the possibility to exchange Collectibles from their collection registered on the Platform or to enter new Collectibles to be exchanged.</p>
<p>They can also define the criteria for the Collectibles they wish to get in an exchange with another Collector.</p>
<p>To find another Collector wishing to exchange their Collectibles, the Collector may either:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Consult the list of Active Collectors, which may be sorted in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.2.1. of these ToU; or</li>
    <li>Consult a Collectible on the Catalogue in order to get acquainted with the Collector.</li>
</ul>
<p>Collectors can then access a dedicated interface on the Platform, allowing them to select the Collectibles for the Swap and validate the Swap. At this stage, the Collectors can discuss the terms of the Swap via a private message service and communicate their addresses to each other.</p>
<p>There can be no financial consideration in the context of the Swap.</p>
<p>The Collectibles are then generally sent by post by the Collectors.</p>
<h5>Moderation of Swaps and fight against fraud</h5>
<p>The Operator is only an intermediary in the context of the matchmaking of the Collectors carrying out a Swap and that does not intervene within the scope of this Swap of Collectibles.</p>
<p>As part of the fight against fraud, NUMISTA implements the following means:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The display of the reviews of each Collector on the page of their profile;</li>
    <li>The display of the number of Swaps considered as being &quot;in progress&quot; (i.e., confirmed but not yet reviewed);</li>
    <li>The possibility for any Collector to report another Collector whose behaviour seems suspicious. In this case, the teams of Moderators may, if necessary, add a warning message to the profile of the Collectors concerned;</li>
    <li>Mechanisms are implemented by NUMISTA in order to detect a Collector having a warning and opening other Accounts on the Platform. Automatic warnings may be added.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Section 8.2.5. Reviews</h4>
<p>In accordance with Section 6 hereof, the Collector may publish a review on the Platform.</p>
<h4>Section 8.2.6. Publications on the Forum</h4>
<p>The discussion forum allows Collectors to discuss on the Platform and, more specifically, to share information or ask questions related to coins and banknotes and to propose improvements or corrections to the Platform.</p>
<p>Any Collector will be able to post messages on the forum.</p>
<p>Volunteer moderators enforce the <a href="https://en.numista.com/help/forum-policy-and-sales-policy-77.html">forum's user's charter</a>, which invites, in particular, to be courteous.</p>
<p>Any message that is aggressive, political, commercial or disclosing the personal information of other Collectors, and more generally not respecting the provisions of Section 9.1. of these ToU will be deleted.</p>
<p>The Moderators may also deny access to the forum to Collectors who do not respect the forum's user charter, either temporarily or permanently.</p>
<h4>Section 8.2.7. Publication of Numisdoc</h4>
<p>Numisdoc is a collaborative encyclopaedia composed of articles on various topics related to numismatics, coin and banknote collections and the use of the Platform.</p>
<p>Any Collector can publish an article within Numisdoc, bearing in mind that any article is read and, if necessary, corrected by a Moderator before publication.</p>
<h4>Section 8.2.8. Publication of Outings</h4>
<p>The Platform proposes a space dedicated to the census of places and outings dedicated to coins and banknotes.</p>
<p>Any Collector can suggest an outing on the Platform, bearing in mind that all content is reviewed and, if necessary, corrected by a Moderator before publication.</p>
<p>Collectors may indicate the outings in which they plan to participate.</p>
<p>In accordance with Section 6 hereof, any Collector may review an outing.</p>
<h4>Section 8.2.9. Messaging</h4>
<p>From the &quot;Messages&quot; tab accessible on their Account, the Collector may send private messages to other Collectors.</p>
<h4>Section 8.2.10. Updating personal information and profile</h4>
<p>From their Account, the Collector can update their personal information as well as the information on their public profile, accessible on the Platform.</p>
<p>From this tab, the Collector may choose a privacy option so that their Collectibles and related information are visible to any internet user, only to Collectors, or only to the Collector.</p>
<h3>Section 8.3. Services offered as part of the Premium Membership</h3>
<p>Optional Services (<em>no advertising and 10 GB of storage space</em>) are offered to Collectors who have taken out a Premium Membership.</p>
<p>To find out the corresponding financial terms, the Collector is invited to make a request by sending an email to the Operator at the following address: <a href="mailto:contact@numista.com">contact@numista.com</a>

<p>Subscription to a Premium Membership is governed by the Terms and Conditions of Subscription.</p>
<h3>Section 8.4. Services offered to Administrators and Moderators</h3>
<p>As a referee, every Administrator has an interface on the Platform dedicated to the administration of coins and banknotes of one or more countries. From this space, the Administrator can check the Catalogue Pages and accept or refuse them.</p>
<p>The Administrator will be able to modify the Catalogue Pages relating to the coins and/or banknotes of the countries for which they are in charge.</p>
<p>The Moderators have access to features that allow them to moderate the contents of the forum or to ban Collectors. From a dedicated validation space, the Moderators can also validate the contents of Numisdoc and the releases.</p>

<p>The Operator shall not be liable if the non-performance or delay in performance of any of its obligations described in these ToU is due to force majeure.</p>
<p>Force majeure occurs in contractual matters when an event beyond the control of the debtor, which could not be reasonably foreseen at the time of the conclusion of the contract and the effects of which cannot be avoided by appropriate measures, prevents the debtor from fulfilling its obligation.</p>
<p>If the impediment is temporary, the performance of the obligation is suspended unless the resulting delay justifies the termination of the contract. If the impediment is definitive, the contract is automatically terminated, and the parties are released from their obligations under the conditions provided for in Sections 1351 and 1351-1 of the French Civil Code.</p>
<p>In the event of the occurrence of one of the aforementioned events, NUMISTA will endeavor to inform the User as soon as possible.</p>
<h2>SECTION 12. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY</h2>
<h3>Section 12.1. Ownership of Collectors’ intellectual rights</h3>
<p>In the course of using the Platform, Collectors may display photographs, trademarks, logos, designs and other models (Content) belonging to them or to third parties.</p>
<p>Any Collector reproducing Content through the Platform warrants that they have the right to display all Content.</p>
<p>In any case, NUMISTA will not be held liable for any act of counterfeiting, given its simple quality of host of the Content published by the Collectors.</p>
<h3>Section 12.2. Ownership of NUMISTA’s intellectual property rights</h3>
<p>The User acknowledges the intellectual property rights of the Operator on the Platform, its components and the contents related to it and waives to contest these rights in any form whatsoever.</p>
<p>The trademarks, logos, slogans, graphics, photographs, animations, videos, software solutions and texts and any other content on the Platform, <strong>with the exception of the Content published by the Collectors</strong>, are the exclusive intellectual property of NUMISTA and may not be reproduced, used or displayed without express authorisation, or otherwise face legal proceedings.</p>
<p>Any display or reproduction, total or partial, of the Platform and its contents, by any process whatsoever, without the prior express authorisation of NUMISTA, is prohibited and will constitute an infringement punishable by the provisions of the French Intellectual Property Code.</p>
<p>In particular, the Operator expressly forbids:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The extraction, by permanent or temporary transfer of all or a qualitatively or quantitatively substantial part of the content of its database on another medium, by any means and in any form whatsoever;</li>
    <li>Reuse, by making available to the public all or a qualitatively or quantitatively substantial part of the contents of the database, in any form whatsoever;</li>
    <li>Reproduction, extraction or reuse, by any means, including methods similar to scrapping of content (photographs, descriptions, etc.) published by the Operator or by a Collector.</li>
</ul>
<p>Acceptance of these Terms of Use implies that the Users acknowledge NUMISTA's intellectual property rights and undertake to comply with them.</p>
<p>The Operator grants a personal, non-exclusive and non-transferable license to the Users authorising them to use the Platform and the information it contains in accordance with these ToU.</p>
<p>Any other use of the Platform and its contents is excluded from the scope of this license and cannot be made without the prior express authorisation of the Operator.</p>
<h2>SECTION 13. PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION</h2>
<h3>Section 13.1. On processing carried out by NUMISTA</h3>
<p>NUMISTA is likely to collect personal data as part of the operation of the Platform</p>
<p>These data are necessary for the management of the Platform, for the provision of the Services and for the matchmaking of Collectors. These data will be retained confidentially by NUMISTA for the needs of the contract, its performance, and in compliance with the law, for a period of 3 years from the end of the commercial relationship if you are a customer or from your last contact if you are not yet a customer.</p>
<p>The data may be communicated in whole or in part to NUMISTA's service providers.</p>
<p>For this reason, the User is invited to consult NUMISTA's Privacy Policy available at the following address <a href="https://en.numista.com/policy.php">https://en.numista.com/policy.php</a> which will give them all the information relating to the protection of personal data and the processing carried out via the Platform.</p>
<p>In accordance with the <em>French Data Protection Act No. 78-17 of 6 January 1978, and Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation, known as the GDPR)</em>, the Operator ensures the implementation of the rights of the data subjects.</p>
<p>The User whose personal data is processed has the right to access, rectify, update, data portability and deletion of information concerning them, as well as a right to limit the processing in accordance with Sections 49, 50, 51, 53 and 55 of the French Data Protection Act and the provisions of Articles 15, 16, 17 and 18 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>
<p>In accordance with the provisions of Section 56 of the French Data Protection Act and Article 21 of the GDPR, the User may also, for legitimate reasons, object to the processing of data concerning them, without reason and without charge.</p>
<p>The User can also define the fate of their data after death and choose that NUMISTA communicates or not their data to a third party that the User will have previously designated.</p>
<p>The User can exercise their rights by sending an email to the address <a href="mailto:contact@numista.com">contact@numista.com</a> or by sending a letter to: <em>NUMISTA - 1 Avenue des Frères Olivier - 06600 ANTIBES, FRANCE</em>.</p>
<p>Finally, the User may also lodge a complaint with the supervisory authorities, in particular the French <em>Commission Nationale de l’Informatique et des Libertés</em>(the “<em>CNIL</em>”) (<a href="https://www.cnil.fr/fr/plaintes">https://www.cnil.fr/fr/plaintes</a>)</p>
<h3>Section 13.2. On processing carried out by Collectors</h3>
<p>The Collector may, as the data controller, have to collect and process the personal data of another Collector in the context of a Swap of Collectibles carried out from the Platform for the sole purpose of carrying out the Swap concerned or for delivery. It may also retain Collectors' data in order to meet their legal obligations or to manage any disputes with these Collectors. In accordance with the regulations, the Collector will delete the personal data of other Collectors after the necessary period.</p>
<p>The Collector warrants that it processes this data in compliance with the rights and obligations arising from the French Data Protection Act and the GDPR, bearing in mind that the processing of data in the domestic context does not fall within the scope of the GDPR.</p>
<h2>SECTION 14. USERS SERVICE</h2>
<p>Any questions or complaints regarding the use or operation of the Platform can be made in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
    <li>On the Platform's forum;</li>

</ul>
<h2>SECTION 15. VALIDITY OF THE TOU</h2>
<p>If any provision of these ToU is found to be invalid by any applicable legislation or regulation and/or by a court decision, it shall be deemed unwritten and shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions, which shall remain in full force and effect.</p>
<p>Such a modification or decision does not authorise Users to disregard these Terms of Use.</p>
<h2>SECTION 16. MODIFICATION OF THE TOU</h2>
<p>These Terms of Use apply to any User browsing the Platform.</p>
<p>The ToU may be modified and updated by NUMISTA at any time, in particular to adapt to legislative or regulatory changes.</p>
<p>The applicable ToU are those in force at the time of the browsing on the Platform.</p>
<h2>SECTION 17. GENERAL PROVISIONS</h2>
<p>The fact that one of the Parties has not demanded the application of any clause of these ToU, whether permanently or temporarily, shall in no case be considered as a waiver of said clause.</p>
<p>In case of difficulty of interpretation between any of the titles appearing at the head of the clauses, and any of these clauses, the titles will be declared non-existent.</p>
<p>In case of any discrepancy between the English language version and the French language version of this Agreement, the latter must prevail.</p>
<h2>SECTION 18. JURISDICTION AND GOVERNING LAW</h2>
<p>THESE TOU, AS WELL AS THE RELATIONS BETWEEN THE USER AND NUMISTA, ARE GOVERNED BY FRENCH LAW.</p>
<p>In the event of a dispute between NUMISTA and a User concerning the interpretation, performance and termination of these ToU, the Parties will endeavor to settle it amicably.</p>
<p>In such a case, the User is first invited to contact the Operator's customer service by email at <a href="mailto:contact@numista.com">contact@numista.com</a> or by mail at the following address: <em>NUMISTA - 1 Avenue des Frères Olivier - 06600 ANTIBES, FRANCE</em>.</p>
<p>If no agreement is reached, an optional mediation procedure will be proposed, conducted in a spirit of fairness and good faith with a view to reaching an amicable agreement in the event of any dispute relating to this contract, including those concerning its validity.</p>
<p>To initiate this mediation, the consumer User may contact the following mediator: <em>Centre de médiation des conciliateurs de justice (CM2C)</em>, who may be contacted by post at the address <em>14 rue Saint Jean – 75017 PARIS, FRANCE</em>, by email to <a href="mailto:cm2c@cm2c.net">cm2c@cm2c.net</a>, or by filling in a form on the website accessible at the following address: <a href="https://www.cm2c.net/declarer-un-litige.php">https://www.cm2c.net/declarer-un-litige.php</a>.</p>
<p>The Party wishing to initiate the mediation process must first inform the other Party by a registered letter with acknowledgement of receipt, indicating the elements of the dispute.</p>
<p>The mediation is not mandatory. The User or NUMISTA can withdraw from the process at any time.</p>
<p>IN THE EVENT THAT MEDIATION FAILS OR IS NOT CONSIDERED, THE DISPUTE THAT MAY HAVE GIVEN RISE TO MEDIATION WILL BE REFERRED TO THE COMPETENT COURT.</p>

    <h2>APPENDIX 1: Information on civil and tax obligations</h2>
    <p>Online platform operators have an obligation to inform any user who carries out commercial transactions on their platform.</p>
    <p>Useful information is gathered in educational sheets, recalling the rules applicable to the declaration of income and the payment of social contributions.</p>
    <p>This information can be found at the following addresses:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Concerning tax obligations, link below:
            <br /><a href="https://www.impots.gouv.fr/portail/files/media/1_metier/1_particulier/EV/1_declarer/141_autres_revenus/eco-collabo-fiscal-vente-biens.pdf">https://www.impots.gouv.fr/portail/files/media/1_metier/1_particulier/EV/1_declarer/141_autres_revenus/eco-collabo-fiscal-vente-biens.pdf</a>
        </li>
        <li>On www.urssaf.fr, concerning social obligations, link below:
            <br /><a href="https://www.urssaf.fr/portail/home/espaces-dedies/activites-relevant-de-leconomie.html">https://www.urssaf.fr/portail/home/espaces-dedies/activites-relevant-de-leconomie.html</a>

        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>We remind you that the explanations below are given for information purposes only and do not replace the reading of French legislative instruments, administrative comments and case law. We would also like to insist on the fact that the rules set out above are subject to change (in particular the different thresholds which are reassessed each year) and that each User of the Platform is solely responsible for their legal obligations.</p>
    <p>In addition, the tax authorities and social security funds are able to complete this basic information and answer any questions.</p>
    <p>NUMISTA therefore recommends that all Users contact their tax office, social security office or a specialist adviser in case of doubt.</p>
