Warranty and Disclaimer</h3><p class="last-paragraph">Kraftful shall use reasonable efforts consistent with prevailing industry standards to maintain the Services in a manner which minimizes errors and interruptions in the Services and shall perform the Implementation Services in a professional and workmanlike manner. Services may be temporarily unavailable for scheduled maintenance or for unscheduled emergency maintenance, either by Kraftful or by third-party providers, or because of other causes beyond Kraftful’s reasonable control, but Kraftful shall use reasonable efforts to provide advance notice in writing or by e-mail of any scheduled service disruption. However, Kraftful does not warrant that the services will be uninterrupted or error free; nor does it make any warranty as to the results that may be obtained from the use of the services. Except as expressly set forth in this section, the services are provided “as is” and Kraftful disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement.</p></div><div class="policy-section"><h3 class="inside-title">8.

Trademarks and Publicity</h3><p class="last-paragraph">The parties hereby grant each other a worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicenseable, limited license to their trademarks and logos solely to market the collaboration under these Terms in publicity materials, including the parties’ websites and social media accounts.</p></div><div class="policy-section"><h3 class="inside-title">10. Changes</h3><p class="last-paragraph">Kraftful may revise these terms from time to time. If Kraftful does revise these terms, the revised terms will supersede prior versions. Unless Kraftful says otherwise, revisions will be effective upon the effective date indicated at the top of these terms. Except to the extent required by GDPR, Kraftful will use reasonable efforts to provide you advance notice of any material revisions. This notice will be provided via the account portal and/or via an email to the email address Kraftful has on file. For other revisions, Kraftful will update the effective date of these terms at the top of the page. We encourage you to check the effective date of these Terms whenever you visit the Website or account portal. Your continued access or use of the Services constitutes your acceptance of any revisions. If you don’t agree to the revisions, you should stop using the Services and Kraftful is not obligated to provide you with the Service. If you have a subscription to any Service, any change to these Terms will be effective with respect to such Services upon the renewal of your subscription.<br/><br/>You acknowledge that Kraftful may change or deprecate features of the Services (including Kraftful SDKs and/or APIs) from time to time. Although Kraftful endeavors to avoid changes to the Services that are not backwards compatible, if any such changes become necessary Kraftful will endeavor to notify you at least thirty (30) days prior to Kraftful’s implementation of any such incompatible changes to the Services of which it becomes aware.<br/><br/>Kraftful’s ability to analyze app store reviews and other publicly available reviews (collectively, the “Public Reviews”) depends on the continued availability of available the Public Reviews. In the event that any source of Public Reviews limits Kraftful’s access to data, Kraftful’s Services may temporarily or permanently be reduced accordingly without any liability to the Company.</p></div><div class="policy-section"><h3 class="inside-title">11.
