        OpenWeather focuses on providing convenient and easy-to-use tools that allow developers to work with
        high-quality weather data and other datasets. We do not collect unnecessary data and our APIs do not require

          is then used to deliver our services</b>.
        <br>
        <br>
        We do <b>not collect or store</b> any parameters from your API requests, such as locations/ZIP-codes/city names,
        units measurements, data format, etc. When you make API requests, we also do not collect or store your IP
        address, user agent and other API request parameters.
        <br>
        <br>
        To support that, below we list all types of data that are collected and explain why we collect them (e.g
        billing, technical support). Please do not hesitate to reach out to our team at <a

      </ul><br>
      <h4 class="policy-list">YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS</h4>
      <p>You have the right to:</p><a id="glossary-request-access"></a>
      <p><b>Request access</b> o your personal data (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables
        you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
      </p>
      <p><b>Request correction</b> of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete
        or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you
        provide to us.</p>
      <p><b>Request erasure</b> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data
        where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it.
        You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised
        your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where
        we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, the further retention of the
        personal data should be lawful where it is necessary, for exercising the right of freedom of expression and
        information, for compliance with a legal obligation, for the performance of a task carried out in the public
        interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller, on the grounds of public interest in
        the area of public health, for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research
        purposes or statistical purposes, or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
      </p>
      <p><b>Object to processing</b> of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a
        third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing
        on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object
        where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that
        we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</p>
      <p><b>Request restriction of processing</b> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the
        processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data’s
        accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to
        hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or
        (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate
        grounds to use it.</p>
      <p><b>Request the transfer</b> of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a
        third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note
        that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or
        where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</p>
      <p><b>Withdraw consent at any time</b> where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However,
        this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you
        withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if
        this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</p>
