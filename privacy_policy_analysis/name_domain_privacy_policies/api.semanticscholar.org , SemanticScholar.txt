<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>Like many websites, AI2 analyzes how visitors use our Sites through what is known as “cookie” technology or similar tracking tools. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your computer when you access the Sites and allows us to recognize you each time you visit the Sites. We may use cookies to: (i) allow you to use the Sites without having to re-enter your user name and password; (ii) enhance or personalize your Site usage and experience; (iii) monitor and track your Site usage; (iv) manage the Sites; and (v) understand, improve and research products, features and services, including to create logs and record when you access the Sites from different devices, such as your work computer or your mobile device, and to provide you with interest-based ads. For more information on our advertising, see below: “Interest-Based Advertising.” You can control cookies through your browser’s settings and other tools. However, if you choose to block certain cookies, you may not be able to register, login, or access certain parts or make full use of the pages and features that are currently on our Sites, or that we may put on our Sites in the future. Note that browser-management tools for cookies are outside of our control and we cannot guarantee their effectiveness. We may combine the information we collect through cookies, web beacons, or other technology tools with other information we have collected from you or information from other sources.</p>
<h2>Interest-Based Advertising</h2>
<p>We may use third-party advertising companies that use tracking technologies to serve our advertisements across the Internet. These companies may collect information about your visits to the Sites and other websites and your interaction with our advertising and other communications. These advertising companies serve ads on behalf of us and others on non-affiliated sites, and some of those ads may be personalized, meaning that they are intended to be relevant to you based on information collected about your visits to the Sites and elsewhere over time.</p>
<p>You have the choice to tell us not to collect and use this information, and in some jurisdictions, we will only engage in interest-based advertising if you opt-in. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices concerning interest-based ads, visit: <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/">http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/</a> or <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices">http://www.aboutads.info/choices</a></p>

<p>If information is aggregated or de-identified so it is no longer reasonably associated with an identified or identifiable natural person, AI2 may use it for any business purpose. Users determine their own policies and practices for the sharing and disclosure of information, and AI2 does not control how they or any other third parties choose to share or disclose information.</p>
<h2>Disclosure of Your Information</h2>
<p>This Section describes how AI2 may disclose your personal information. Depending on how you interact with us and the Sites, we may disclose your personal information in the following ways and contexts. We may disclose information collected from and about you as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>To our related companies and service providers, to perform a business, professional or technical support function for us;</li>

</ol>
<p>We may also disclose your personal information with your express consent. If information is aggregated or de-identified so it is no longer reasonably associated with an identified or identifiable natural person, AI2 may share it with third parties. Please note that if you voluntarily submit any personal information for posting on the Sites, such as a review or a blog post, the information becomes publicly available and can be collected and used by others, so you should use care before posting information about yourself online. We cannot control the actions of other users with whom you may choose to share your information. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that your information will not be viewed by unauthorized persons. You understand that when you use public areas of the Sites, your information will be available to other users and in some cases may be publicly available. We recommend you be cautious about giving out personal information to others or sharing personal information in public areas, whether designated as public or private. We are not responsible for the personal information you choose to share in these public areas or for the actions of any third parties with whom you share personal information.</p>
<h2>Access, Correction, and Deletion</h2>
<p>We respect your right to access and correct your personal information. You may exercise your rights, subject to applicable laws, to request that we delete or restrict access to your personal data. We may need to retain it for legally permitted purposes and this will be explained to you if necessary. In addition, if you have claimed your author page in our Semantic Scholar service (“Semantic Scholar”) as described in the “Service Specific Details” section below, you may access your personal information by signing into your account. From there, you can correct or modify your information. If you need assistance correcting or updating your personal information, or would like to request that we delete your personal information, please contact us using the contact information detailed in the “Contact” section below.</p>
<h2>Data Retention</h2>
<p>We retain your personal information that we collect, access or process only for as long as necessary for the fulfillment of the purposes for which it was collected unless otherwise provided in agreements between you and AI2 or as required or authorized by law. Personal information that is no longer required to fulfill the identified purposes will be destroyed, erased or made de-identified.</p>
<h2>Data Security</h2>
<p>We work hard to protect information you provide from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access or disclosure. We take into account the sensitivity of the information we collect, process and store, and the current state of technology. We follow generally accepted standards designed to protect the information submitted to us, both during transmission and once it is received. If you have any questions about the security of your information, you can contact us using the contact information detailed in the “Contact” section below. Given the nature of communications and information processing technology, AI2 cannot guarantee that information, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our systems or otherwise in our care, will be absolutely safe from intrusion by others. The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where AI2 has given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of the Sites, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone, and we urge you to be careful about giving out information in public areas of the websites like message boards. The information you share in public areas may be viewed by any user of the Sites.</p>
<h2>Third Party Websites</h2>
<p>The Sites may contain links to, or other options to redirect to or integrate with, third-party websites, such as (but not limited to) social media sites like Facebook and Twitter, which may have privacy policies that differ from our own. We are not responsible for the activities and practices that take place on these websites. Accordingly, we recommend that you review the privacy policy posted on any external site before disclosing any personal information. Please contact those websites directly if you have any questions about their privacy policies.</p>
<h2>Locations of Processing</h2>
<p>Your information will be stored and processed by AI2 in the United States. We take steps, including through contracts, to ensure that the information continues to be protected wherever it is located in a manner consistent with the standards of protection required under applicable law. If you are visiting the Sites from outside the United States, your information may be transferred to, stored and processed in the United States or other countries in accordance with this privacy policy. Where personal information is transferred from the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or Switzerland, we rely on appropriate safeguards such as the European Commission-approved Standard Contractual Clauses and Privacy Shield Frameworks to transfer the data and/or as otherwise authorized by applicable law. The data protection and other applicable laws of the United States or other countries may not be as comprehensive as those laws or regulations in your country or may otherwise differ from the data protection or consumer protection laws in your country. Your information may be available to government authorities under lawful orders and law applicable in such jurisdictions. By using the Sites and/or providing personal information to us, you consent to transfer of your information to our facilities as described in this privacy policy.</p>
<h2>Grounds for Processing</h2>
<p>When we collect from you any personal information within the scope of European data protection laws, we do so:</p>
<ol>
<li>Where necessary to provide the Sites, fulfill a transaction or otherwise perform a contract with you or at your request prior to entering into a contract;</li>
<li>Where necessary for our compliance with applicable law or other legal obligation;</li>
<li>Where necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest;</li>
<li>Where applicable, with your consent;</li>
<li>As necessary to operate our business, protect the security of our systems and users, detect or prevent fraud, or fulfill our other legitimate interests as described in the sections above, except where our interests are overridden by your privacy rights; and/or</li>
<li>Where necessary to complete scientific research where omitting such personal information would render impossible or seriously impair the achievement of the specific scientific research purpose.</li>
</ol>
<p>Where we rely on your consent to process personal information, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time, and where we rely on legitimate interests, you may have the right to object to our processing.</p>
<h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>AI2 may change this privacy policy from time to time. Laws, regulations and industry standards evolve, which may make those changes necessary, or we may make changes to our business. We will post the changes to this page and encourage you to review our privacy policy to stay informed. Under certain circumstances, we will provide additional notice, such as via email or through the Sites. If you disagree with the changes to this privacy policy, you should deactivate your account and immediately cease using the Sites.</p>

We recommend you be cautious about giving out\n            personal information to others or sharing personal\n            information in public areas, whether designated as public or\n            private. We are not responsible for the personal information\n            you choose to share in these public areas or for the actions\n            of any third parties with whom you share personal\n            information.\n        \n        3.  You may choose to permit or restrict Third Party Providers\n            from interacting with the Services. Typically, Third Party\n            Services are software that integrates with our Services, and\n            User can permit its Authorized Users to enable and disable\n            these integrations. Once enabled, the provider of a Third\n            Party Service may share certain information with AI2.\n            Authorized Users should check the privacy settings and\n            notices in these Third Party Services to understand what\n            data may be disclosed to AI2. When a Third Party Service is\n            enabled, AI2 is authorized to connect and access other\n            information made available to AI2 in accordance with our\n            agreement with the Third Party Provider. We do not, however,\n            receive or store passwords for any of these Third Party\n            Services when connecting them to the Services.\n    \n    3.  **Automated Technologies - Device and\n        usage data**: The Service may also automatically collect\n        information about how you and your device interact with the\n        Service, such as:\n        \n        1.

Usage data, such as the features you used, the settings you\n            selected, URL click stream data, including date and time\n            stamp and referring and exit pages, and pages you visited on\n            the Service;\n        \n        3.  For educational Services, the course modules and test\n            questions you view, answer or complete; and/or\n        \n        4.  For location-aware Services, the physical location of your\n            device.\n\n3.  **COOKIES.** We collect data through our servers and the use of\n    cookies and other technologies. You can control cookies through your\n    browser's settings and other tools. However, if you choose to block\n    certain cookies, you may not be able to register, login, or access\n    certain parts or make full use of the Service. We use cookies to\n    track website use to help us learn how well the Services perform.

Develop and provide search, learning and productivity tools and\n        additional features.\n\n    If information is aggregated or de-identified so it is no longer\n    reasonably associated with an identified or identifiable natural\n    person, AI2 may use it for any business purpose. Users determine their\n    own policies and practices for the sharing and disclosure of\n    information, and AI2 does not control how they or any other third\n    parties choose to share or disclose information.\n\n5.  **DATA RETENTION.** We retain your information for as long as\n    necessary to provide the Service and fulfill the transactions you\n    have requested, or for other essential purposes such as complying\n    with our legal obligations, maintaining the Service, resolving\n    disputes, maintaining security, detecting and preventing fraud and\n    abuse, enforcing our agreements and other legitimate interests.\n\n6.  **DATA SECURITY.** We work hard to protect information you provide\n    from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access or disclosure. We take\n    into account the sensitivity of the information we collect, process\n    and store, and the current state of technology. We follow generally\n    accepted standards to protect the information submitted to us, both\n    during transmission and once it is received. If you have any\n    questions about the security of your information, you can contact us\n    at \u003clegal@allenai.org\u003e Given the nature of communications and\n    information processing technology, AI2 cannot guarantee that\n    information, during transmission through the Internet or while\n    stored on our systems or otherwise in our care, will be absolutely\n    safe from intrusion by others. The safety and security of your\n    information also depends on you. Where AI2 has given you (or where\n    you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of the\n    websites, you are responsible for keeping this password\n    confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone, and\n    we urge you to be careful about giving out information in public\n    areas of the websites like message boards. The information you share\n    in public areas may be viewed by any user of the websites.\n\n7.  **LOCATIONS OF PROCESSING.** Your information will be stored and\n    processed by AI2 in the United States. We take steps, including\n    through contracts, to ensure that the information continues to be\n    protected wherever it is located in a manner consistent with the\n    standards of protection required under applicable law. Where\n    personal information is transferred from the European Economic Area\n    (“EEA”) or Switzerland, we rely on appropriate safeguards such as\n    the European Commission-approved Standard Contractual Clauses and\n    Privacy Shield Frameworks to transfer the data and/or as otherwise\n    authorized by applicable law.\n\n8.  **GROUNDS FOR PROCESSING.** When we collect from you any personal\n    information within the scope of European data protection laws, we do\n    so:\n    \n    1.  where necessary to provide the Service, fulfill a transaction or\n        otherwise perform a contract with you or at your request prior\n        to entering into a contract;\n    \n    2.  where necessary for our compliance with applicable law or other\n        legal obligation;\n    \n    3.  where necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the\n        public interest;\n    \n    4.  where applicable, with your consent;\n    \n    5.  as necessary to operate our business, protect the security of\n        our systems and Users, detect or prevent fraud, or fulfill our\n        other legitimate interests as described in the sections above,\n        except where our interests are overridden by your privacy\n        rights; and/or\n    \n    6.  where necessary to complete scientific research where omitting\n        such personal information would render impossible or seriously\n        impair the achievement of the specific scientific research\n        purpose.\n\n        Where we rely on your consent to process personal information, you\n        have the right to withdraw your consent at any time, and where we rely\n        on legitimate interests, you may have the right to object to our\n        processing.\n\n9.  **CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY.** AI2 may change this privacy\n    policy from time to time. Laws, regulations and industry standards\n    evolve, which may make those changes necessary, or we may make\n    changes to our business.

Semantic Scholar\n        ([www.semanticscholar.org](http://www.semanticscholar.org)):\n        \n        1.  We collect author names as publicly accessible metadata from\n            the web, publishers and other sources for display across our\n            website including in association with papers, presentations,\n            blog posts, code repositories, videos and\n            citations/references. This data and content is stored\n            indefinitely, but can be removed for display from our\n            public-facing website by blacklisting the associated content\n            (note: we currently only have blacklisting tools for\n            presentations, papers, figures and tables). Blacklisting\n            does not result in complete deletion of the associated\n            content.\n        \n        2.  We use the author name from this publicly accessible\n            metadata to auto-generate author pages where we display\n            content associated with an author, compute citation\n            statistics and display links to other authors.\n        \n        3.  Author profile pages can be updated by using the “Suggest\n            Changes” or “Claim Author Page” button on an author’s page\n            to add/remove papers, add an affiliation, add a link to a\n            homepage and add an ORCID ID to an author’s profile.\n            Requesters who submit changes are required to provide their\n            first and last name, e-mail address and justification which\n            we store in a database to validate the request.\n        \n        4.  We provide multiple options to sign in via third-party\n            providers such as, for example, Google, Facebook and\n            Twitter. As part of the sign-in process we collect and store\n            the data such as user name, screen name, auth token,\n            affiliation. Please contact us if you’d like further\n            information about the data provided by your sign in\n            provider.\n","id":"2020-04-02"}},"url":{"id":"2020-04-02"}},{"doc":{"metadata":{"tags":[]},"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"wf5t1ptx352c"}},"id":"29BchEr9IfHfT9eJjDhL5w","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2020-03-12T22:25:51.405Z","updatedAt":"2020-03-13T19:53:11.658Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":46,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"privacyPolicy"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"dateOfChange":"2018-07-30T00:00-07:00","descriptionOfChanges":"Original version.","text":"*Effective: July 30, 2018*\n\nThe Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence (“AI2”) is committed to\nmaintaining your confidence and trust with respect to your privacy.\nPlease read this privacy policy carefully to understand our practices\nabout how we collect, use and share your personal information.\n\n1.  **ABOUT OUR PRIVACY POLICY**\n    \n    1.  This privacy policy applies when you visit or use our websites\n        and other services, including events, that refer or link to this\n        privacy policy (each, a “**Service**”). It also describes your\n        choices regarding use, access and correction of your personal\n        information. If you do not agree with the terms of this privacy\n        policy, do not access or use the Services.

This privacy policy does not apply to any third party\n        applications or software that integrates with the Services, or\n        any other third party products, services or businesses (“**Third\n        Party Services**”). In addition, a separate agreement may govern\n        delivery, access and use of the Services (the “**User\n        Agreement**”), including the processing of any content submitted\n        through your use of the Services (collectively, “**User\n        Data**”).

Data that you provide to us as part of interacting with the\n            Service, such as your saved papers, email alerts, favorites\n            and search queries; and/or\n        6.  Communications preferences, such as your preferred language\n            and the frequency, type and format of the alerts you sign up\n            to receive.\n    2.  **Third Party Sources**: Data from other sources: We also may\n        obtain contact details and other information about you from our\n        parent corporation, affiliates and subsidiaries (collectively,\n        “PGA Group”) as well as from third parties, including: (1)\n        third party companies or individuals that help us process\n        information and support the Services (“Third Party Providers”);\n        and (2) publicly-available sources and data suppliers from which\n        we obtain data to validate or supplement the information we\n        hold.\n        1.  This data may be combined with other information we collect\n            and might include aggregate level data, such as which IP\n            addresses correspond to zip codes or countries.\n        2.  We cannot control the actions of other users with whom you\n            may choose to share your information. Therefore, we cannot\n            and do not guarantee that your information will not be\n            viewed by unauthorized persons. You understand that when you\n            use public areas of the Services, your information will be\n            available to other users and in some cases may be publicly\n            available. We recommend you be cautious about giving out\n            personal information to others or sharing personal\n            information in public areas, whether designated as public or\n            private.

You may choose to permit or restrict Third Party Providers\n            from interacting with the Services. Typically, Third Party\n            Services are software that integrates with our Services, and\n            User can permit its Authorized Users to enable and disable\n            these integrations. Once enabled, the provider of a Third\n            Party Service may share certain information with AI2.\n            Authorized Users should check the privacy settings and\n            notices in these Third Party Services to understand what\n            data may be disclosed to AI2. When a Third Party Service is\n            enabled, AI2 is authorized to connect and access other\n            information made available to AI2 in accordance with our\n            agreement with the Third Party Provider. We do not, however,\n            receive or store passwords for any of these Third Party\n            Services when connecting them to the Services.\n    3.  **Automated Technologies - Device and usage data**: The Service\n        may also automatically collect information about how you and\n        your device interact with the Service, such as:\n        1.

Usage data, such as the features you used, the settings you\n            selected, URL click stream data, including date and time\n            stamp and referring and exit pages, and pages you visited on\n            the Service;\n        3.  For educational Services, the course modules and test\n            questions you view, answer or complete;\n        4.  For location-aware Services, the physical location of your\n            device.\n\n3.  **COOKIES.** We collect data through our servers and the use of\n    cookies and other technologies. You can control cookies through your\n    browser's settings and other tools. However, if you choose to block\n    certain cookies, you may not be able to register, login, or access\n    certain parts or make full use of the Service. We use cookies to\n    track website use to help us learn how well the Services perform. We\n    also use cookies to understand, improve and research products,\n    features and services, including to create logs and record when you\n    access the Services from different devices, such as your work\n    computer or your mobile device.

Semantic Scholar\n        ([www.semanticscholar.org](http://www.semanticscholar.org)):\n        1.  We collect author names as publicly accessible metadata from\n            the web, publishers and other sources for display across our\n            website including in association with papers, presentations,\n            blog posts, code repositories, videos and\n            citations/references. This data and content is stored\n            indefinitely, but can be removed for display from our\n            public-facing website by blacklisting the associated content\n            (note: we currently only have blacklisting tools for\n            presentations and papers). Blacklisting does not result in\n            complete deletion of the associated content.\n        2.  We use the author name from this publicly accessible\n            metadata to auto-generate author profile pages where we\n            display content associated with an author, compute citation\n            statistics and display links to other authors.\n        3.  Author profile pages can be updated by using the “Suggest\n            Changes” button on an author’s profile page to add/remove\n            papers, add an affiliation, add a link to a homepage and add\n            an ORCID ID to an author’s profile. Requesters who submit\n            changes are required to provide their first and last name,\n            e-mail address and justification which we store in a\n            database to validate the request.\n        4.  We provide multiple options to sign in via Google, Facebook\n            and Twitter. As part of the sign-in process we collect and\n            store the following data:\n            1.  Twitter: user full name, user screen name (handle), auth\n                token\n            2.  Facebook: first name, last name, full name, email, auth\n                token\n            3.  Google: full name (display name), email, auth token\n    2.  Semantic Scholar Labs Website\n        (\u003chttp://labs.semanticscholar.org\u003e)\n        1.  Citeomatic requires a PDF or abstract of a paper to provide\n            citation recommendations. For debugging purposes, we may log\n            metadata about the uploaded paper (title, abstract, authors\n            and references). We do not log or store the full text of any\n            uploaded paper. PDFs that are uploaded or fetched from an\n            external URL are not stored persistently. PDFs are discarded\n            after metadata has been extracted from them. To facilitate\n            sharing results, we save a cache of predictions, which\n            includes the title, author(s), abstract and bibliography\n            information extracted from a paper. We may inspect this\n            cache at the request of a user or to facilitate debugging.\n        2.  ScienceParse Demo: Requires upload of a PDF to demo metadata\n            extraction including title, authors, abstract and\n            bibliography information. PDFs and extracted metadata are\n            not stored, but rather deleted immediately.\n    3.  Common Sense/Beaker:\n        1.  Beaker and Common Sense allow a user to create accounts.\n            Account information is stored on both AI2 servers as well as\n            Third Party Providers to facilitate future account access.\n        2.  Accounts include email address, name and organization.\n        3.  With an account, users can create datasets and run\n            experiments in the cloud\n        4.  Datasets and experiments may be private or shared more\n            broadly with other users or the public.\n        5.  Datasets and experiments are archivable through a\n            soft-delete, but data may be stored within the system for an\n            arbitrary amount of time.\n        6.  Public datasets and experiments may be used in featured\n            content or to highlight the use of the leaderboard and\n            Beaker.\n        7.  AI2 engineers may view private datasets or experiments for\n            monitoring and debugging purposes.\n","id":"2018-07-30"}},"url":{"id":"2018-07-30"}}],"displayVersion":{"doc":{"metadata":{"tags":[]},"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"wf5t1ptx352c"}},"id":"rQYOAsJGvVByNCQ4khQvM","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2022-07-21T22:19:59.041Z","updatedAt":"2022-07-21T22:19:59.041Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"privacyPolicy"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"dateOfChange":"2022-07-21T00:00-07:00","descriptionOfChanges":"Transcription of existing privacy policy to MD, done as of July 21, 2022.","text":"# AI2 Privacy Policy\n\n*Last Updated: September 1, 2021*\n\nThe Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence (“AI2” or “We”) is committed to maintaining your confidence and trust with respect to your privacy.
