Failure to honor these terms will result in your use of the Humor API being suspended and/or permanently blocked. </p> <h2>License</h2> <p> A Humor API subscription grants you a nonexclusive, non-transferable license to use the Humor API on a month-by-month basis dependent on your payment of the monthly fee associated with your subscription (and any additional charges due to exceeding the number of calls per day covered by your subscription) and on your agreement to respect these terms. You will be charged every month until you cancel your subscription under My Console > Plan/Billing or on RapidAPI's website, depending on where you subscribed. </p> <p> You must agree to keep your Humor API key confidential. If you post or commit code in a support forum, GitHub, etc., you must first remove the Humor API key. If your Humor API key is compromised and abused by an unauthorized user, you are responsible for its misuse and for any additional charges or harm incurred. </p> <p> Humor API reserves the right to include the Humor API logo, links to Humor API, and/or advertisements (e.g. links or images related to sponsors) in the Humor API, including its widgets. </p> <h2>Prohibitions</h2> <p> You may use the data provided by the Humor API as part of your website, application, or other project, but you cannot use Humor API data to create a site or application meant to provide the same experience as Humor API. Should Humor API determine that your website or application is attempting to compete with Humor API’s website/apps or to drive traffic away from Humor API in another way, you will no longer be allowed to use the Humor API. In this case, however, you may reach out to us to discuss a possible business partnership. </p> <p> You may not create the impression that your site or application is endorsed by Humor API, nor may you use any Humor API brands/logos to promote your site/app without prior permission. Again, please reach out if you would like to work more closely together - in some cases we may discount your Humor API use. However, if you are invited by Humor API to a free, custom plan for hackathons or academic use, then you must provide a backlink to our food API page (link above). </p> <p> You may not scrape the Humor API or in any way attempt to copy or store the information it provides, including any derived, hashed, or transformed data. With prior written permission from Humor API, you may cache user-requested data to improve performance (for a maximum of 1 hour). After 1 hour, you must delete your cache and refresh the data via the Humor API. If you stop using the Humor API or if your access to the API is suspended for any reason, then you must delete all data you ever obtained from the Humor API. </p> <p> You may not resell any data received via the Humor API. </p> <p> You may use the Humor API in order to compare the Humor API to Humor API competitors. </p> <p> We reserve the right to discontinue the Humor API or to withdraw your permission to use the Humor API at any time for any reason without notice. </p> <h2>Disclaimer</h2> <p> The Humor API and all the data it consists of are intended for informational purposes only, and are provided "as is," "with all faults," and "as available." This means that while Humor API will do its best to ensure the quality of the Humor API and the accuracy of Humor API data, there are no guarantees or warranties (neither expressed nor implied), including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. Humor API is not accountable for any losses, damages, or any other problems that occur because the Humor API is unavailable or slow, because the data contains errors, or because of any text or images that you show on your website, in your app, etc., even if the text or image(s) come from the Humor API. </p> <p> By using the Humor API, you agree to assume all responsibility and risk of use of the Humor API. Humor API is not responsible or liable for any consequences that result from your use of the Humor API and the content, materials, and information it contains. </p> <p> You also agree that Humor API may use your logo and company name as a professional reference/use case. If you do not want this, please let us know in written form. </p> <p> Nothing in these Terms of Use shall be construed as creating an employer-employee relationship, a partnership, a joint venture, or any other type of business relationship without an express written agreement between the parties. </p> <h2>Representations and Indemnification</h2> <p> You represent and warrant that you have the necessary power and authority to enter into this Agreement. If you are agreeing to these Terms on behalf of your employer or other entity, you represent and warrant that you have full legal authority to bind your employer or such entity to these Terms of Use. You will fully indemnify, hold harmless and defend Humor API from any and all claims, damages, losses, liabilities, actions, judgments, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees and costs) brought by a third party arising out of or in connection with your use of the Humor API. </p> <h2>LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY</h2> <p>IN NO EVENT WILL Humor API BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR LOST PROFIT DAMAGES, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE API TERMS, WHETHER BASED ON BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER OR NOT IT HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE. THE LIMITATIONS SPECIFIED IN THIS SECTION WILL SURVIVE AND APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY SPECIFIED IN THESE API TERMS OF USE IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.</p> <h2>Choice of Law</h2> <p> The terms and conditions of this Agreement are governed by and shall be construed in accordance with the laws of Indiana, located in the United States of America. All disputes arising out of or in connection with the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts of Indiana. </p> <h2>Updates</h2> <p> These Terms of Use may be updated or revised. You are responsible for regularly reviewing these Terms of Use so long as you continue to use the Humor API. If necessary, you will need to change your websites/app/etc. to be in compliance with these terms. Your continued use of the Humor API after changes to the Terms of Use will constitute acceptance of and agreement to such changes. </p> <p> Last Updated on September 1, 2021 </p> </div> </div>   <section class="mega-footer-layout-1"> <div class="container"> <div class="row"> <div class="col-lg-3 col-md-12"> <div class="footer-link"> <h3>Info</h3> <ul> <li><a href="/terms">Terms & Conditions</a></li> <li><a href="https://discord.gg/d8VwXbznhr">Discord</a></li> <li><img src="/img/climate-badge.svg" style="width:30px;margin-right:10px">1% for fighting climate change</li> </ul> </div> </div> <div class="col-lg-3 col-md-12"> <div class="footer-link"> <h3>API Resources</h3> <ul> <li><a href="/docs">Full Documentation</a></li> <li><a href="http://status.humorapi.com/">Uptime Status</a></li> <li><a href="/sdks">SDKs</a></li> </ul> </div> </div> <div class="col-lg-3 col-md-12"> <div class="footer-link"> <h3>Learning Resources</h3> <ul> <li><a href="https://a.paddle.com/v2/click/8410/37868?link=3480">Email Humor Course</a></li> <li><a href="https://frstre.com/go/?a=103115-9b1a52&s=1438770-b02ff2&p_affiliate.referral_code=davidurbansky">Audio Humor Course</a></li> <li><a href="/funny-movies">Funniest Movies</a></li> <li><a href="/funny-books">Funniest Books</a></li> </ul> </div> </div> <div class="col-lg-3 col-md-12"> <div class="footer-link"> <h3>Awesome APIs</h3> <ul> <li><a href="https://apileague.com/" target="_blank">API League</a></li> <li><a href="https://worldnewsapi.com/" target="_blank">News API</a></li> <li><a href="https://spoonacular.com/food-api/" target="_blank">Recipe API</a></li> <li><a href="https://bigbookapi.com/" target="_blank">Books API</a></li>  </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div> </section>  <script> var referrer =  document.referrer;
