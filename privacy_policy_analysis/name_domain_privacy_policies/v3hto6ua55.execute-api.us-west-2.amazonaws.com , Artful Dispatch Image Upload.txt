    <h1>Privacy Policy for Verbari Online Service</h1>
    
    <p>At Verbari LLC, we value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and retain certain data when you use our online service. By using our service, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We retain server logs of API requests. The information we collect includes information submitted on your behalf by ChatGPT (namely, the link to an AI generated image and inscription text), as well as certain information appended to that request by OpenAI. These identifiers can be traced to individuals by OpenAI, and can be associated to orders made through our service.</p>

    <h2>2. Use of Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information collected for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To facilitate the generation of personalized cards based on your input.</li>
        <li>To improve and optimize our service.</li>
        <li>To maintain security and prevent misuse of our platform.</li>
        <li>To comply with legal and regulatory requirements.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Billing Information</h2>
    <p>We do not store billing or shipping information on our servers. We rely on our trusted partner, Stripe, an industry-leading payment processor, to handle all billing-related data. Stripe takes several security measures to protect your payment information, including encryption, PCI compliance, and regular security audits. You can review Stripe's privacy policy for more information about how they handle your data.</p>

    <h2>4. Use of Personal Information</h2>
    <p>We may use personal information you provide for business purposes, such as mailing cards to the intended recipients, completing customer service requests, and billing related matters. Rest assured that we will not use your personal information for any other purposes without your explicit consent.</p>

    <h2>5. Law Enforcement and Reporting Illegal Activity</h2>
    <p>We comply with lawful requests from law enforcement and will report any illegal activity we become aware of. We take our responsibility to assist with legal matters seriously and will cooperate fully with authorized law enforcement agencies.</p>

    <h2>6. Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>Upon your request, we will delete your data from our systems. Please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@verbari.com">privacy@verbari.com</a> with your request, and we will promptly process your request in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.</p>

    <h2>7. Security</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, please be aware that no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is entirely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

    <h2>8. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. Any changes will be posted on this page, and the effective date will be updated accordingly. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically.</p>
