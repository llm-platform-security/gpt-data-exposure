            This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect your personal information when you use the "Browser" application ("the App"), a ChatGPT plugin developed by Lionel Kubwimana.
          </p>
          <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
          <p>We may collect non-personal usage data to improve the functionality and user experience of the App. This data does not identify you personally.</p>

          <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
          <p>
            Any information we collect is used solely for the purpose of improving the App. We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your information to third parties.
          </p>

          <h2>3. Cookies</h2>
          <p>
            The App may use cookies to enhance user experience. You can choose to disable cookies in your browser settings, but this may affect the functionality of the App.
          </p>

          <h2>4. Data Protection</h2>
          <p>
            We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of any information we collect. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
          </p>

          <h2>5. Third-Party Links</h2>
          <p>
            The App may contain links to third-party websites. These third-party sites have separate and independent privacy policies. We have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites.
          </p>

          <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
          <p>
            We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page. Your continued use of the App after changes to the Privacy Policy signifies your acceptance of the changes.
          </p>
