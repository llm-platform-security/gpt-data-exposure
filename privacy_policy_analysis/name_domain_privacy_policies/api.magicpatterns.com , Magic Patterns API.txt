In some cases we may be required legally to collect or disclose personal information; in which case we will make this clear.

<p>The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) is a new data privacy law that applies to certain businesses which collect Personal Information from California residents. The law went into effect on January 1, 2020. Magic Patterns now offers data protection terms pursuant to the EU GDPR and UK GDPR in Europe and the same terms under the CCPA. Your rights under the CCPA are described below.</p>
<p>Please note that Magic Patterns does not rent or sell any Personal Information.</p>
<p>In addition, California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the “Shine The Light” law, permits California residents to request and obtain from us, once a year and free of charge, 1) information about categories of Personal Information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes, and 2) the names and addresses of the third parties with which we shared Personal Information in the preceding calendar year.</p>
