      <p>
        The Diagrams: Show Me plugin is dedicated to enhancing your diagramming
        experience within ChatGPT, prioritizing both functionality and your
        privacy.
      </p>
      <h2>About Our Plugin</h2>
      <p>
        Diagrams: Show Me is a powerful tool designed for the quick creation and
        editing of diagrams. It supports various diagram languages, with a focus
        on mermaid graph diagrams, providing an engaging visual alternative to
        text.
      </p>
      <h2>Data Collection and Usage</h2>
      <p>
        We collect essential data related to the diagrams you create using our
        plugin. Our collaboration with third-party services, including Miro,
        Cloudfare, and Mixpanel, is central to our operations. The integration
        with Miro, in particular, is a revenue-generating feature that offers
        enhanced functionality such as drag-and-drop capabilities. This
        collaboration, along with others, is vital for improving our services
        and user experience. The data we collect is used primarily for service
        enhancement, including fixing rendering issues and optimizing
        performance.
      </p>
      <h2>Data Sharing and Monetization</h2>
      <p>
        We share data with trusted third parties like Miro, Cloudfare, and
        Mixpanel to enhance our plugin's functionality and efficiency. Our
        partnership with Miro is not only instrumental in providing advanced
        features but also contributes to our revenue stream. However, we are
        committed to handling your data responsibly and do not engage in
        selling, trading, or indiscriminately sharing your information.
      </p>
      <h2>Policy Updates</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this privacy policy as needed, with changes being posted
        on this page. Our commitment is to uphold transparency and trust in our
        data handling practices.
