<h1 class="text-center">Privacy Policy</h1>
	<p>Thank you for visiting our website at <a href="https://researcher.life/">researcher.life</a> (“Website”). Your privacy is important to us, and Cactus Communications, including its subsidiaries and affiliates (“CACTUS,” “the Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) is committed to protecting your privacy whilst providing a personalized and valuable service.</p>
	  <p>Here at CACTUS, we are committed to safeguarding your data while rendering our professional services. This Website comprises a portfolio of services and products offered by CACTUS that operates through various group entities including, but not limited to, entities located in Singapore, India, Japan, China, South Korea, Denmark, the United Kingdom, and the United States.</p>
	  <p>This Privacy Policy governs our data collection, processing, and usage practices. It is designed to allow you to make an informed choice regarding use, access, and collection of your Personal Information.</p>


	  <h2>Personal Data That We Collect</h2>
		<p>We may collect from you your personal data when you provide us with it, for example in response to a survey, when you apply for a job, register for events, register for personalized services, request information about products, use our services, or request customer support. Personal Information such as full name, gender, date of birth, country location, postal address, zip code, job title, company information, e-mail addresses, telephone numbers, commercial information, such as purchase history and referral source, payment information (including bank and other details) billing address, and work and education profile. This data may include IP address, operating system, and browser type. We also collect data relating to your personal preferences with regard to the journals you like to read, your most preferred published papers, etc. (“Personal Information”). We do not intentionally collect more personal data than described here. However, if you at your choice, intentionally or unintentionally disclose some personal data other than the description provided in this paragraph then such data shall continue to be governed by this Privacy Policy. We may also have acquired your Personal Information from a third-party service provider or publicly available data source.</p>
<p>We do not collect any special categories of personal data about you (such as details about your race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political opinions, trade union membership, information about your health and genetic and biometric data). Nor do we collect any information about criminal convictions and offences.</p>
	<p>The Website may contain links to other sites. CACTUS is not responsible for the privacy notices or the content of such third-party websites even if:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>You accessed the third-party website using links from our Website; or</li>
		<li>You accessed our Website using links from a third-party website.</li>
	</ul>

	  <h2> How We Use Your Personal Data </h2>

		<h3 class="sub-head">As a Data Controller:</h3>
		<p>We use the Personal Information we collect only in compliance with this Privacy Policy. We will never sell your Personal Information to any third party without your explicit consent. In addition to the uses identified elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, we may use your Personal Information to (a) assist you with service, partnership, or employment request; (b) send to you information that we think may be of interest to you by post, email, or other means; (c) send you marketing communications relating to our business, current services, new services or promotions; (d) respond to an enquiry, question, or concern that you may have raised; (e) perform analytics and create a database to improve your browsing experience and enhance the functionality of our services; or (f) send you on email or by any other means a suggested reading list based on your personal preferences submitted to us. </p>
        <p>We may share Personal Information with trusted service providers or our affiliates for payment processing, supplementing the information you provide us in order to provide you with better service, account administration, perform statistical analysis, provide marketing assistance, host the Website, index user profile pages and usernames as part of the URL, technical and customer support. Any third parties receiving your Personal Information from us are prohibited from using your Personal Information except for these purposes, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information. </p>
		<p>After you place an order on our Website, you may need to make payments for the services you have ordered. In order to process your payments, we use a number of third-party payment processors. Your payment will be processed by the payment provider you choose to process your payment via a payment gateway. If you give us banking or other payment mode details, we solely use such details to process payment refunds, if any, to you. The third-party payment processors we use also collect, use, and process your information, including payment information, in accordance with their respective privacy policies.</p>
        <p>To ensure that the security and integrity of the Website is safeguarded, CACTUS may monitor your Personal Information. CACTUS may under certain circumstances engage a trusted third-party service provider for the purpose of managing the technical operations involved in hosting the Website. </p>
        <p>We will share the Personal Information, if disclosure was required by law, rule or regulation or was in response to a valid order of a court or authorized agency of government or other legal process. We may be required to process Personal information for legal and compliance reasons, such as the prevention, detection, or investigation of a crime, loss prevention or prevention of fraud. We may also use Personal Information to meet our internal and external audit requirements and for information security purposes.</p>

		<h3 class="sub-head">International Transfer of Personal Information:</h3>
		<p>To facilitate our global operations, we may transfer and access your Personal Information across geographical borders to our subsidiaries or affiliates or service providers working on our behalf in other countries with different data protection laws that may not be on par with that of the origin country. A transfer of personal information has a broad meaning and occurs when information is communicated, moved, accessed or otherwise sent to another country. This Privacy Policy shall apply even if we transfer Personal Information to countries outside your country.</p>
		<p>To the extent that it may be necessary, and solely for the purposes of providing the service available on the Website to you, we may disclose to such third party any of your Personal Information that may be necessary for the procurement of services from the third party.</p>
	<p>In cases where personal information would need to be transferred outside of a country where CACTUS operates, towards other jurisdictions, specific requirements may apply for such Transfer to be allowed. We may also transfer personal information to a third party located outside your country of origin without having to implement the above measures if you have given consent to us for the transfer of your Personal Information.</p>
	<p>As of now, your Personal Information is being transferred via internet to a third-party service provider Amazon Web Services in either Singapore, India, USA or Japan for hosting/back-up the data on cloud. The data is encrypted at rest and in transit.</p>
	<p>By using the services, you expressly agree to the transfers of personal data to third countries where this requires your consent.</p>

		<h3 class="sub-head">As a Data Processor:</h3>
		<p>We shall use and process the information or data we collect through Data Controllers/Controllers (“Business Partners”) as per the instructions given by Controllers and in compliance with the terms and conditions applicable to Processors under the Controller/Processor Binding Agreement entered with the Controllers and applicable Regulations. We agree not to process such information to sub-processors (Sub-contractor), unless prior written consent is sought from the Controller, and in the event where general consent has been given by the Controller, we shall inform the Controller of any new sub-processor. We shall have the same contractual obligations reflected with the sub-processors as agreed with the Controller and assume complete responsibility for the actions and inactions of such sub-processors.</p>
		<p>Upon written request from the Controller, we agree to delete or return all the Personal Information or data to the Controller after the end of the provision of services relating to processing, unless there is a legal obligation or basis for us to retain a copy of such information or data for further processing.</p>
		<p>In addition to implementation of appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure an appropriate level of security, we shall make available to the Controller all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with our obligations and allow the Controller or another auditor appointed by the Controller for conducting audits, including inspections, to demonstrate that processing meets the requirements of the Regulation, and ensure the protection of the rights of the data subject.</p>
