<h2>Last Updated: December 13, 2023</h2>
<p>This privacy policy (‚ÄúPrivacy Policy‚Äù) outlines the information collection, usage, and sharing practices of SoMeeToo (‚Äúwe,‚Äù ‚Äúus,‚Äù or ‚Äúour‚Äù).

<h3>Automatically Collected Information:</h3>
<p><strong>Device and Usage Information:</strong> We collect information about your device and how you interact with our services, including device ID, geolocation (with your permission), device specifications, and usage patterns.
Cookies and Web Beacons: We use cookies and web beacons to track visitor behavior, personalize your experience, and for advertising purposes.
Information from Other Sources:</p>
<p><strong>Third-Party Services:</strong> Information from analytics providers and advertising partners may be collected.</p>
<p><strong>User-Provided Information:</strong> Other users may provide information about you, such as in customer support inquiries.</p>

<p><strong>Referrals:</strong> You can refer friends to our service, providing their contact information for a one-time message.</p>
<h3>Discord Bot and Group Interaction Monitoring:</h3>
<p><strong>Discord Bot Integration:</strong> SoMeeToo utilizes a bot within our Discord channel to facilitate private group creation and provide users with helpful information like guides or recommendations.</p>
<p><strong>Monitoring for Safety and Compliance:</strong> The bot may also be used to monitor interactions within these groups to ensure compliance with legal standards and SoMeeToo&#x27;s community guidelines. This includes observing conversations and group dynamics to prevent illegal activities or violations of our terms of service.</p>
<p><strong>Data Collection by the Bot:</strong> The bot collects data on user interactions within these groups, which helps us improve our services and ensure a safe, compliant environment for all users.</p>
<h2>How We Use the Information:</h2>
<p>In accordance with this Privacy Policy, the information we collect from you may be used for the following purposes:</p>
<p><strong>Facilitate Group Hangouts:</strong> To match you with other SoMeeToo users based on shared interests and preferences to organize group hangouts.</p>
<p><strong>Customer Service:</strong> To respond to your comments, questions, and provide customer support, enhancing your experience with SoMeeToo.</p>

<p><strong>Consented Purposes:</strong> For any specific purposes disclosed to you when we collect your information or as explicitly consented by you.</p>
<p><strong>Use for Research:</strong> In addition to the uses outlined above, by using SoMeeToo, you consent to allow us to use information from your experiences anonymously for ongoing research into successful social interactions and group dynamics. This research aims to improve the SoMeeToo experience and may be shared publicly (e.g., in blogs or interviews), but all personal information will remain confidential and anonymous.</p>
<h2>Sharing Your Information:</h2>
<p>The information we collect is essential for providing and enhancing the SoMeeToo service. We commit to not sharing your personal information with other parties without your consent, except in the following circumstances:</p>
<p><strong>Other Users:</strong> To facilitate group hangouts, we may share your profile information with other SoMeeToo users as per our service functionality. Once matched, you may choose to share additional information with these users.</p>

<p><strong>Legal Disclosures and Business Transfers:</strong> We may disclose your information without prior notice or consent in response to legal requests (e.g., subpoenas, court orders) or to enforce our rights, protect our property, or defend against legal claims. In cases of business transfers, such as mergers, acquisitions, or bankruptcy, your information may be transferred as part of the business assets.</p>
<p><strong>Interactions with Third-Party Services:</strong> If you use third-party services in conjunction with SoMeeToo (e.g., social media login options), these services may collect information about your activities on SoMeeToo. Their use of your information is governed by their own privacy policies.</p>
<p><strong>Aggregate Data:</strong> We may aggregate or de-identify your information so that it cannot reasonably be used to identify you. Such data falls outside the scope of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Third-Party Data Collection and Interest-Based Advertising:</strong> While SoMeeToo does not sell personal information, we may allow third parties to collect information through our service for business purposes, including interest-based advertising. These third parties&#x27; information practices are not governed by this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h2>Updating or Removing Account Information:</h2>
<p><strong>Reviewing and Editing Your Profile:</strong> You have the ability to review and modify your profile information at any time. Simply log into your SoMeeToo account using the credentials you provided during the registration process.</p>
<p><strong>Deleting Your Account:</strong> If you wish to have your account information deleted, you can request this by contacting us. We will first deactivate your account and then proceed with permanently deleting your account. Please note that the deletion process will remove all your data from our records.</p>
<p><strong>Continued Communication:</strong> Even after account deletion, there may be instances where we might need to contact you. These could be related to ongoing or past requests you have made with SoMeeToo, or to respond to your inquiries.</p>
<p><strong>Opting Out of Communications:</strong> If you prefer not to receive further messages from SoMeeToo, you can opt out by ceasing to use our services and refraining from making any further inquiries or requests. This will remove you from our mailing lists and communication channels.</p>

<p><strong>Contact for Privacy Rights:</strong> contactsomeetoo@zngverse.com</p>
<p>We encourage you to reach out to us with any concerns or requests related to your privacy rights, and we will endeavor to respond in a timely and respectful manner.</p>
<h2>Third Party Sites</h2>
<p>SoMeeToo may include links to external websites and services. Clicking on a third-party link will direct you to that site or service. It&#x27;s important to note that our linking to these sites does not imply endorsement, authorization, or affiliation with these third parties, nor does it imply an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies. We have no control over these third-party websites or services. These third parties may independently collect data or solicit personal information, and they may have their own privacy policies. We recommend that you read the privacy policies of any external websites or services you visit.</p>
<h2>Data Retention</h2>
<p>SoMeeToo retains the personal information we collect for as long as needed to provide our services, resolve disputes, enforce our agreements, conduct audits, pursue legitimate business purposes, and comply with applicable laws. The duration for which we retain your personal information depends on the purposes for which it was collected and its nature, and any mandatory data retention laws.</p>
<h2>Securing Your Personal Information</h2>
<p>We are committed to protecting your personal information and treat it securely in line with this Privacy Policy. However, no internet-based service can guarantee absolute security. We cannot ensure the security of your information transmitted to our services, and any transmission is at your own risk. If we become aware of any security breach, we will attempt to notify you electronically, such as by posting a notice on our platform or sending you an email. You may be entitled to receive this notification in writing, depending on legal requirements.</p>
<h2>Your Choices</h2>
<p><strong>Cookies:</strong></p>
<p>You have the option to refuse or disable cookies through your browser settings. As each browser is different, please consult your browser‚Äôs help menu for instructions.
Refusing or disabling cookies may impact the functionality of SoMeeToo, potentially limiting your ability to use some of its features.
You can manage your preferences for third-party advertising through sites like Network Advertising Initiative and About Ads.</p>
<p><strong>SMS Messages:</strong></p>
<p>If SoMeeToo sends SMS messages for verification or notifications, you can opt out by following the instructions in the message or contacting SoMeeToo support.</p>
<p><strong>Mobile Devices:</strong></p>
<p>SoMeeToo may send push notifications to your mobile device. You can opt out of these notifications in your device‚Äôs settings.
Most mobile devices offer settings to limit ad tracking, which you can adjust according to your preferences.
You can also disable GPS location services in your device settings if you prefer not to share location information.</p>
<p><strong>Do Not Track Signals:</strong></p>
<p>Some browsers have a ‚ÄúDo Not Track‚Äù feature that signals to websites you visit that you do not want to have your online activity tracked. SoMeeToo currently does not respond to these signals due to the lack of a standardized understanding of how to interpret them.</p>
