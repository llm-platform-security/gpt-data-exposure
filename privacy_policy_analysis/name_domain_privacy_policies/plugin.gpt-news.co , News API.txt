          <h3>1. Nature & Limitations of Generative AI</h3>
          <p>The services ("news", "one news", "alpha news") incorporate generative artificial intelligence ("Generative AI"). By its very nature, AI utilizes algorithms and extensive datasets to generate content, which inherently carries potential unpredictability and limitations.</p>

Generative Innovations does not guarantee or warrant the reliability, completeness, or accuracy of the AI-generated content.</p>

          <h3>3. User's Reliance on AI-generated Content</h3>
          <p>Users expressly acknowledge and agree that any information, content, or output provided by or influenced by the Generative AI should not be the definitive basis for significant decisions, including but not limited to financial, personal, or business contexts. It remains imperative for users to employ discretion, validate information from authoritative sources, and obtain professional advice when necessary.</p>

          <p>Generative Innovations, its affiliates, and its licensors are not liable for any claim, damages, or other liabilities, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the AI-generated content. Users agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Generative Innovations and its licensee and licensors, and their employees, contractors, agents, officers, and directors, from and against any claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses (including but not limited to attorney's fees), resulting from or arising out of use or misuse of the AI-powered services.</p>
