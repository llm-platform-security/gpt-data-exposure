                <h3>4-2. Disclosure to Sellers of Goods and Services</h3>
                <p>We provide your personal information to sellers and relevant service providers (each a “Merchant”), including those located outside of Japan, when you use the Services to purchase products, or to request transaction related services such as a booking confirmation or a product delivery (including offers to make transactions). In such cases, we only disclose your information in Section 2 (“<a href="#cont2">The Information We Collect</a>”) to the extent necessary to effect the transaction.</p>
                <p>Personal information provided for the purpose of effecting transactions between you and Merchants is managed by the Merchants. In addition to completing the transaction you have requested, Merchants may use your personal information for the purposes of providing you with information via email newsletters after the transaction, analyzing your purchases and use of their services, or for the improvement of their own business operations.</p>
                <p>Please click <a href="https://corp.rakuten.co.jp/privacy/en/data-transfers.html">here</a> if you would like to learn about the privacy laws in countries where personal information is sent when it is provided to Merchants outside of Japan.</p>
                <p>Please exercise caution when disclosing any information to the Merchants as any information which you disclose directly to the Merchants will not be governed by this Policy. Any such disclosure will be subject to the privacy notices that they provide.</p>
                <h3>4-3. Disclosure to Other Third Parties</h3>
                <p>In addition to the disclosures described above, we may also disclose your personal information to certain trusted third party service providers, including those located outside of Japan, where necessary to carry out our business operations.</p>
                <p>Please be assured that we will only disclose your personal information in compliance with applicable laws, and with the appropriate management and supervision of the relevant third parties.</p>
                <p>Occasionally, judicial or regulatory authorities may request access to or disclosure of information about you for law enforcement purposes. Such requests typically pertain to criminal investigations or other legal proceedings. Where they are necessary and legitimate, we will respond to such requests in accordance with our internal policies and applicable laws.</p>
                <p>Additionally, in cases where it is necessary to prevent and mitigate fraudulent or illegal activities (3-1-6.), or to protect life, body, or property, we may disclose your personal information to another Rakuten Group company or to a third party.</p>
				<p>Furthermore, we may share your personal information with any third party that purchases, or to which we transfer, all or substantially all of our assets and business. Should such a transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to try to ensure that the entity to which we transfer your personal information uses it in a manner that is consistent with this Policy.</p>
				<p>We may disclose any type of your information in Section 2 (“<a href="#cont2">The Information We Collect</a>”) to the minimum necessary in order to achieve the purpose of the disclosure.</p>
				<p>We will not use or disclose your information for purposes not set forth in this Policy without informing you and taking any necessary steps in advance as required under applicable law.</p>
                <h3>4-4. Analysis by Personal Information Matching and Use in Advertisement Delivery</h3>
                <p>We match and analyze your personal information obtained from third parties (Rakuten Group companies and business partners with whom we have entered into agreements with) with your personal information that we already manage. For example, in order to deliver advertisements that are more customized for you, we match and analyze personal information (such as your advertising identifiers, email addresses, and phone numbers) received from third parties with advertising identifiers and other personal information that we have about you. In addition, for third parties to improve and develop their marketing and services, we match and analyze personal information received from third parties with your personal information, process it into a format from which you cannot be personally identified, and then provide it to such third parties.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, we provide to third parties the personal information that we manage (business partners with whom we have entered into agreements that provide advertising delivery and other services*) in order to deliver advertisements. For example, in order for third parties to deliver advertisements to you, we disclose personal information (including advertising identifiers, email addresses, and phone numbers) to these third parties. Such information is matched and analyzed with personal information and personal referable information (advertising identifiers etc.) managed by these third parties so they can deliver advertisements that are more customized for you. When doing so, these third parties use your personal information for the delivery of advertisements that we have requested.</p>
                <p>*A list of the business partners that provide advertising delivery services and the names of the countries for those business partners located outside of Japan is available <a href="https://corp.rakuten.co.jp/privacy/en/data-transfers.html">here</a>.</p>
                <p>We may also provide your personal information such as your advertising identifiers to third parties, including advertisers, in order to confirm the results of advertising, award points, and fulfill other purposes. These third parties may link this information to personal information such as advertising identifiers or personal referable information that they manage. This information is then provided to us along with information such as condition achievement information. We will link the information we receive with information we manage in order to confirm the results of advertising and to award points.</p>

                <p>We may receive information related to you (personal referable information) such as identifiers and behavior history from third parties that do not hold personally identifiable information such as your name. Subsequently, we link this to your personal information to use such information in accordance with the purposes explained in Section 3.1 (“Use of Your Information”), except where other purposes are indicated. Specifically, we collect cookies, mobile advertising identifiers, email addresses and phone numbers (including those that have been through irreversible conversion processing), advertisement delivery logs such as the number of views for advertisements, website viewing and search histories, purchase histories (including shopping done at brick-and-mortar stores), location information and other behavior history, and television viewing logs. This information is used after linking it to personal information we manage. In such cases, the information is managed properly as personal information in accordance with applicable laws.</p>

                <p>We are committed to handling your personal information in accordance with high security standards and in compliance with applicable law. We do so in order to prevent unauthorized access or unauthorized disclosure of your information, to maintain the accuracy of such information and, when necessary, to ensure its proper destruction. When collecting or transferring your personal information, we employ data encryption technology, and restrict access only to those persons who require it to fulfil their job responsibilities. We conduct periodic reviews of our practices to ensure that our safeguards are properly implemented and remain state of the art. Please also refer to “Details about Our Information Security” below to learn about the security management measures that we take.</p>
                <p>Details about Our <a href="https://global.rakuten.com/corp/sustainability/services/security/">Information Security Practices</a>.</p>
				<p>Because of the global nature of our business, the information that we collect from you may be transferred to countries whose data protection laws are not as comprehensive as those from where you are based. The main countries and regions to which your personal information is transferred through our business activities include the United States, Singapore, and India. When we transfer personal information overseas, in addition to ascertaining the privacy protection legal systems of those countries and regions, we put in place appropriate safeguards (such as contractual commitments) in accordance with applicable legal requirements to ensure that your data is adequately protected. For more information on the appropriate safeguards in place, please contact us via the method described in (“<a href="#cont10">Contact Us</a>”). For global data processing within us, we put in place adequate measures including Binding Corporate Rules we implemented, a recognized European data protection standard. Binding Corporate Rules (the “BCRs”) provide for an appropriate level of protection. Our rules have been approved by the relevant European Union Authorities and these are also a strong commitment to protect your privacy around the world. Rakuten&apos;s BCRs are available here: <a href='https://corp.rakuten.co.jp/privacy/en/bcr.html'>https://corp.rakuten.co.jp/privacy/en/bcr.html</a></p>
				<p>In order to maintain the security of your Account it is essential that you take adequate measures to protect your password.

Please treat any email or other communication requesting your password as unauthorized and suspicious and forward the communication to us, using the contact method provided in “<a href="#cont10">Contact Us</a>”.</p>
				<p>If you do share your Rakuten password with a third party for any reason, including when the third party has promised to provide you additional services such as account aggregation, the third party will have access to your Account and your personal information. In such cases, to the extent that the liability is not attributable to us, we are not liable for any losses or damages that you may incur as a result of activities that take place on your Account. If you believe someone else has obtained unauthorized access to your password, please change it and contact us immediately.</p>
