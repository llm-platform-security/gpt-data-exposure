For more information on these efforts, see <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/shapeshift-creates-fox-foundation-as-intermediary-for-successful-dao-transition" target="_blank">this article</a>. As a result of this transition, user data in connection with user accounts of the ShapeShift platform were transferred from ShapeShift Global Limited to Fox Foundation in order for our users to enjoy a seamless transition and to avoid any downtime of the platform or the deletion of their accounts, which is a legitimate interest of ShapeShift Global Limited. Please note, that if you have a user account on the ShapeShift platform you have a right to object to the transfer of your user account. If you wish to exercise your right to object to such transfer, you may do so by emailing privacy@foxfoundation.io and requesting that the Fox Foundation delete your account and any associated personal data (subject to legal requirements) within 30 days of this notice. IF YOUR SHAPESHIFT ACCOUNT IS DELETED, YOU WILL LOSE ACCESS TO YOUR SHAPESHIFT NATIVE WALLET UNLESS YOU WROTE DOWN YOUR SEED PHRASE. Additionally, you will no longer be eligible for any benefits accrued in connection with a registered ShapeShift account, such as entry in promotions. For further details, see our terms of service. If your account has been deleted under your right to object, you may re-register for a new account at any time.</p></div><div class="wrapperbottom"><div class="legal w-richtext"><p>This privacy policy lists the data privacy practices and processes of Fox Foundation, a nonprofit foundation formed in Lichtenstein (“ShapeShift”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) and includes detailed descriptions of the third-party services we utilize to collect and process your data. Protection and security of the data of our users is very important to ShapeShift and our affiliates, as is your trust in us and the services we provide. ShapeShift is committed to handling your data responsibly and in compliance with all legal requirements. This policy describes how we collect, process, transfer, and secure your personal data when you access and use ShapeShift.com, ShapeShift.io, any of our mobile applications, or any other product or service offered by ShapeShift (“<strong>Services</strong>”). All other aspects of your interaction with our Services are governed by our <a href="https://shapeshift.com/terms-of-service">Terms of Service</a> (“<strong>Terms</strong>”). Any conflicts between this policy and the Terms will be resolved in favor of this policy.<br/><br/><strong>YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THIS POLICY<br/></strong>By accessing or using the Services, are accepting all aspects of this policy. If we require additional or direct consent from you to further process your personal information, we will ask for your consent for the collection, use, or disclosure of your personal information. We may provide additional &quot;just-in-time&quot; disclosures or information about the data processing practices of specific Services. These notices may supplement or clarify our privacy practices or may provide you with additional choices about how we process your data. <strong>If you do not agree with or you are not comfortable with any aspect of this policy, you should immediately discontinue access or use of our Services.<br/><br/>HOW WE MAY CHANGE THIS POLICY</strong><br/>ShapeShift, in its sole discretion, may modify or update this policy at any time, so you should review this page periodically. If we update this policy, the “last modified” date will list the month when such update(s) were made. If we make any material changes to this policy, we notify our registered users via email and summarize those changes. Your continued use of our Services after any change to this policy is deemed your acceptance of such change(s).<br/><br/><strong>WITH WHOM WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL DATA<br/></strong>In connection with our Services, to protect our legitimate interests, to fulfill legal requirements, or to perform under agreements we enter into (including our Terms), we may be required to share your personal data with our affiliate ShapeShift US, Inc., with our business partners (described in more detail below), as well as with public authorities in connection with a facially valid official law enforcement request. Specifically, such sharing of data may be necessary to manage your registration (such as to verify your identity), to respond to your inquiries, to execute a transaction you request, to provide access to additional information, or to inform you about new Services or offers. Further, to the extent we are legally required by public authorities or courts, we will share your personal data with them or other third-parties. The data sharing may include transfers to companies or organizations in countries without an adequate standard of data protection. In these cases, we transfer personal data in accordance with applicable provisions on the international transfer of personal data, such as, where applicable, the respective provisions of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“<strong>GDPR</strong>”). <strong>By accessing our Services, you expressly allow us to export data outside of the jurisdiction in which you reside or are located when you utilize the Services.</strong><br/><strong><br/></strong><strong>DATA WE COLLECT AND PROCESS IN ORDER TO MAKE THE SERVICES GENERALLY AVAILABLE<br/></strong>You can use some aspects of our Services, including our websites, and obtain information about our Services without telling us who you are, however, when accessing any website, a user makes a connection with a webserver, which automatically logs and stores certain technical data including: that user’s internet protocol address (“<strong>IP Address</strong>”), the operating system of that user’s device, the time the website was accessed, or the web browser used to access the site. Logging this data is required in order to make the Services available to you and other users and ensure the functionality of the Services. To the extent we, thereby, process such personal data, we do so based on our legitimate interest to bring you the best possible user experience and to safeguard the security and stability of our systems. <br/><br/>Similarly, our Services use Google Fonts (previously known as Google Web Fonts), a library of open-source font families that enhance your browsing experience, which are licensed by Google LLC (“<strong>Google</strong>”). To integrate Google Fonts into our websites, your browser establishes a connection to Google’s server and the IP Address of your device is transmitted to Google. Google logs records of font queries and protects this data from unauthorized access. Google analyzes aggregated data to optimize Google Fonts and identify which websites use Google Fonts. Further information on Google Fonts can be found <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">here</a> and information on how Google handles personal data can be found <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en">here</a>. <br/><br/>We use Amazon Web Services (“<strong>AWS</strong>”) to host all of our websites. Thus, any data collected by us on any of our websites will be stored on AWS’s servers in the Republic of Ireland. Some of this data is either processed by us directly or transferred to and processed by one of our third-party partners, both of which are described in further detail in this policy. AWS provides a list of frequently asked questions about their data privacy practices <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/data-privacy-faq/">here</a>.<br/><br/><strong>DATA WE COLLECT AND PROCESS TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO YOU, SPECIFICALLY<br/></strong>If you interact with registration, application, order, or inquiry forms on the Services (e.g. signing up for an account, namely in order to use our Services; application for becoming an affiliate of ShapeShift; or requesting support for the Services), we will collect and process the information that you provide to us providing the Services and information about the Services to you, including providing asset management dashboard services. This information may include your:</p><ul role="list"><li>full name; </li><li>residence address; </li><li>date of birth; </li><li>phone number; </li><li>social security number or other tax identification number; </li><li>details about your government issued identification such as identification number and expiration date or a copy of the identification document; </li><li>e-mail address; and</li><li>election to use two-factor authentication (“2FA”) on our services.</li></ul><p>Any wallet you connect to our Services will provide us with such wallet’s: extended public keys, which are used to derive public digital wallet addresses (known as “<strong>xPubs</strong>”); transaction history; and digital asset balance. You can select the “forget my wallet” option at any time to disconnect your wallet (and xPubs) from our services. Some aspects of the Services may be inaccessible without a connected wallet.</p><p>The collection of words associated with a wallet, commonly known as “<strong>Seed Phrases</strong>” are extremely important because they provide a back-up method to access your wallet. ShapeShift does not have access to or store Seed Phrases of its users. We highly encourage you to write down all Seed Phrases upon the time they are issued to you in connection with a wallet, and thereafter store them in a secure location. SHAPESHIFT MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ASSIST YOU IF YOU CANNOT ACCESS YOUR WALLET DUE TO A FORGOTTEN/LOST PASSWORD OR SEED PHRASE.</p><p>If you use the Google single-sign-on option (“<strong>SSO</strong>”), which is denoted by the “Sign up with Google button”, Google will automatically provide us with your email address upon your successful sign-in with Google.</p><p>Where such processing of your personal data is not strictly necessary to perform our contractual obligations (such as in connection with providing financial services to you) or at your request, we will use this personal data based on our legitimate interest to: verify your identity; respond to your inquiry; process your registration, applications, or orders; develop, enhance, and improve the Services to bring you the best possible experience; or to safeguard the security and stability of the Services. <strong>‍</strong></p><p><strong>DATA WE COLLECT AND PROCESS TO ANALYZE AND IMPROVE THE USE OF THE SERVICES; OUR USE OF COOKIES<br/></strong>Based on our legitimate interest to bring you the best possible user experience, we collect and process certain data to analyze how our users use of the Services to gain insight on how we may improve our Services. This data may include information on the type of web browser or device you use to access the website, the geographical region where you access the website, the date and time of your access, and the parts of the website you access.</p><p>We also use “<strong>Cookies</strong>”, which are text files that are downloaded to your computer or mobile device when you visit a website to analyze the use of the website, to optimize our Services, and to enable the use of marketing tools. You can prevent the storage of Cookies on your device and the collection of data. By adjusting your web-browser’s settings accordingly.
