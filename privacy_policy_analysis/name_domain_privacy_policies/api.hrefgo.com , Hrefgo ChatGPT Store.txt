        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to the Hrefgo GPT Interface Service. This privacy policy is intended for users of the Hrefgo GPT Interface Service. Hrefgo is committed to protecting the data and ensuring the privacy of users interacting with our services.</p>

        <h2>Data Handling Practices</h2>
        <p><strong>Authentication:</strong> GPT are authenticated through their respective platforms. No personal data from the GPT or the authentication process is stored by Hrefgo.</p>
        <p><strong>Data Collection:</strong> No personal information is actively gathered from GPT. Interaction data, such as selected text, generated interactions, and content created through the Hrefgo.com platform, is collected purely to process user inquiries and to improve service performance.</p>
        <p><strong>Data Storage:</strong> Collected data is securely stored within the United States, emphasizing data security and privacy integrity.</p>

        <h2>Content Generation and Rights
</h2>
        <p><strong>Content Creation: </strong> The Hrefgo GPT Service includes a feature for content generation. Hrefgo will generate long-form content based on user requests, which is public and can be accessed via a provided URL on Hrefgo.com.</p>
        <p><strong>Anonymity and Access:</strong> The content is created through a process initiated by users via GPT. Due to this process, Hrefgo is unable to obtain specific user information and cannot ascertain the exact ownership of the generated content.</p>
        <p><strong>Rights and Distribution:</strong> Given the anonymous nature of content creation and the inability to attribute specific ownership, the generated content is considered to be in the public domain. Hrefgo retains the rights to use, distribute, and repurpose the content. However, Hrefgo acknowledges that the content is generated based on user input and will endeavor to respect the spirit of user contributions in its use of such content.</p>
    </section><section>
        <h2>Data Sharing

</h2>
        <p><strong>Processing Requests:</strong> When GPT initiate requests to Hrefgo servers, these may be forwarded to OpenAI, Microsoft, or subsequent AI service providers. Data sharing is confined to the content provided by the GPT, ChatGPT, and their generated queries.</p>

        <h2>Policy Modifications</h2>
