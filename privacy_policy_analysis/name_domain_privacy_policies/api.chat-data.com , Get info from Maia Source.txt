Automated Information Collection<br />In addition to the information that you provide to us, we may also collect information about you during your visit to our Website. We collect this information using automated tools that are detailed below. These tools may collect information about your behavior and your computer system, such as your internet address (IP Address), the pages you have viewed, and the actions you have taken while using the Website. Some of the tools we use to automatically collect information about you may include:<br />a. Cookies. A “cookie” is a small data file transmitted from a website to your device’s hard drive. Cookies are usually defined in one of two ways, and we may use either (or both) of them:<br />session cookies, which do not stay on your device after you close your browser, and<br />persistent cookies, which remain on your device until you delete them or they expire.<br />We use the following categories of cookies on our Website.<br />Strictly Necessary Cookies. These cookies are essential to enable you to move around the Website and use its features. Without these cookies, services you have requested, such as maintaining a record of your purchased items (e.g. a shopping cart), cannot be provided.<br />Performance Cookies. These cookies collect anonymous information on how you use our Website to help us understand how you arrive at our Website, browse or use our Website and highlight areas where we can improve, such as navigation. The data stored by these cookies never shows personal details from which your individual identity can be established.<br />Functionality Cookies. These cookies remember choices you make such as the country from which you visit our Website, your preferred language, and your search parameters. This information can then be used to provide you with an experience more appropriate to your selections and to make your visits to our Website more tailored to your preferences. The information in these cookies may be anonymized. These cookies cannot track your browsing activity on other websites.<br />Targeting Cookies or Advertising Cookies. These cookies collect information about your browsing habits to make advertising more relevant to you and your interests. They are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as help measure the effectiveness of an advertising campaign. The cookies are usually placed by third-party advertising networks. These cookies remember the websites you visit, and that information is shared with other parties, such as advertisers.<br />If you do not wish to have cookies on your devices, you may turn them off at any time by modifying your internet browser’s settings. However, by disabling cookies on your device, you may be prohibited from full use of the Website’s features or lose access to some functionality.<br />b. Google Analytics. The Website sends aggregated, non-Personal Information to Google Analytics for the purpose of providing us with the ability to conduct technical and statistical analysis on the Website’s performance. For more information on how Google Analytics supports the Website and uses information sent from the Website, please review Google’s privacy policy available at https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites.<br />c. Web Beacons. A Web Beacon is an electronic image. Web Beacons can track certain things from your computer and can report activity back to a web server allowing us to understand some of your behavior. If you choose to receive emails from us, we may use Web Beacons to track your reaction to our emails. We may also use them to track if you click on the links and at what time and date you do so. Some of the third-party marketers we engage with may use Web Beacons to track your interaction with online advertising banners on our Website. This information is only collected in aggregate form and will not be linked to your Personal Information. Please note that any image file on a webpage can act as a Web Beacon.</p>
<p><br />d. Embedded Web Links. Links provided in our emails and, in some cases, on third-party websites may include tracking technology embedded in the link. The tracking is accomplished through a redirection system. The redirection system allows us to understand how the link is being used by email recipients. Some of these links will enable us to identify that you have personally clicked on the link, and this may be attached to the Personal Information that we hold about you. This data is used to improve our service to you and to help us understand the performance of our marketing campaigns.</p>
<p><br />e. Third-party Websites and Services (Advertising Partners). We work with several service providers of marketing communications technology. These service providers may use various data collection methods to improve the performance of the marketing campaigns we are contracting them to provide. The information collected can be gathered on our Website and also on the websites where our marketing communications are appearing. For example, we may collect data where our banner advertisements are displayed on third-party websites.<br /> <br />6. Your Choices and Selecting Your Privacy Preferences<br />We want to provide you with relevant information that you have requested.<br />If we provide subscription-based services, such as email newsletters, we will allow you to make choices about what information you provide at the point of information collection or at any time after you have received a communication from us while you are subscribed. Transactional or service-oriented messages are usually excluded from such preferences, as such messages are required to respond to your requests or to provide goods and services, and are not intended for the purposes of marketing.<br />We will not intentionally send you email newsletters and marketing emails unless you consent to receive such marketing information. After you request to receive these emails, you may opt out of them at any time by selecting the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of each email. Please note that by opting out or unsubscribing you may affect other services you have requested we provide to you, in which email communication is a requirement of the service provided.<br />7. Accuracy and Access to Your Personal Information<br />We strive to maintain and process your information accurately. We have processes in place to maintain all our information in accordance with relevant data governance frameworks and legal requirements. We employ technologies designed to help us maintain information accuracy on input and processing.<br />To view and change the Personal Information that you have provided to us, please contact us directly at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="97f6f3fafef9d7e0f2fbfbfcf6e4f6b9f4f8fa">[email&#160;protected]</a> for assistance.<br />8. Right to be Forgotten/ Right to request the deletion of Your Personal Information<br />You can ask us to erase or delete all or some of your Personal Information. To request deletion of the Personal Information that you have provided to us, please contact us directly at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="0f6e6b6266614f786a6363646e7c6e216c6062">[email&#160;protected]</a> for assistance. Requests to delete Personal Information shall be subject to any applicable legal and ethical reporting or document filing or retention obligations imposed on us.<br />Please note that by requesting us to delete the Personal Information that you have provided to us, we cannot continue to provide our services to you.<br />9. Retention of Your Personal Information<br />We keep your information for no longer than necessary for the purposes for which it is processed. The length of time for which we retain information depends on the purposes for which we collected and use it and/or as required to comply with applicable laws.<br /> <br />10. Information of Minors<br />We do not intentionally seek to gather information from individuals under the age of thirteen (13). We do not target the Website to minors and would not expect them to be engaging with our Website or services. We encourage parents and guardians to provide adequate protection measures to prevent minors from providing information unwillingly on the internet. If we are aware of any Personal Information that we have collected about minors, we will take steps to securely remove it from our systems.<br />11. How We Use Your Information<br />The information we gather and that you provide is collected to provide you information and the services you request, in addition to various other purposes, including, but not limited to:<br />Assisting you with items such as personalized experiences and facilitation of product usage.<br />Preventing malicious activity and providing you with a secure experience.<br />Providing service and support for services you request.<br />Providing marketing communications that are effective and optimized for you.<br />Keeping you up to date with the latest benefits available from us.<br />Preventing unwanted messages or content.<br />Measuring the performance of our marketing programs.<br />Contacting you about services and offers that are relevant to you.<br />12. How We Share Your Information<br />We do not sell or lease your Personal Information to any third party. We may disclose your Personal Information to our trusted third-party business partners in accordance with this Policy. We work with several partners that help us process your requests, deliver customer service and support, send email marketing communications, and provide experiences that you have come to expect from us. We will share your Personal Information with these third parties to fulfil the service that they provide to us. These third-party partners are under contract to keep your Personal Information secure and not to use it for any reason other than to fulfil the service we have requested from them.<br />Except as described in this Policy, we will not share your information with third parties without your notice and consent, unless it is under one of the following circumstances:<br />Responding to duly authorized information requests from law enforcement or other governmental authorities.<br />Complying with any law, regulations, subpoena, or court order.<br />Investigating and helping prevent security threats, fraud, or other malicious activity.<br />Enforcing or protecting the rights and properties of Company or its subsidiaries.<br />Protecting the rights or personal safety of Company’s employees.<br />There are circumstances where the Company may decide to buy, sell, or reorganize its business in selected countries. Under these circumstances, it may be necessary to share or receive Personal Information with prospective or actual partners or affiliates. In such circumstances, the Company will ensure your information is used in accordance with this Policy.<br />13. Third-party Websites<br />This Policy does not apply to websites or other domains that are maintained or operated by third parties or our affiliates. Our Website may link to third-party websites and services, but these links are not endorsements of these sites, and this Policy does not extend to them. Because this Policy is not enforced on these third-party websites, we encourage you to read any posted privacy policy of the third-party website before using the service or site and providing any information to any such Third-party Websites.<br />14. Your California Rights<br />Pursuant to California Civil Code Section 1798.83, we will not disclose or share your Personal Information with third parties for the purposes of third-party marketing to you without your prior consent.<br />Other than as disclosed in this Policy, the Website does not track users over time and across third-party websites to provide targeted advertising. Therefore, the Website does not operate any differently when it receives Do Not Track (“DNT”) signals from your internet web browser.<br />If you are a California consumer, as defined by the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“Act”), please be advised that Wellkasa Inc. does not currently meet the regulatory thresholds of a “business” as that term is defined under the Act and therefore is not required to comply with the Act. Regardless, all Personal Information will be processed in accordance with this Policy.<br />15. For Website Visitors Outside of the United States<br />Our Website is designed for use by individuals in the United States only. We do not warrant or represent this Policy or the Website’s use of your Personal Information complies with the laws of any other jurisdiction. Furthermore, to provide you with our services, we may store, process, and transmit information in the United States and other locations around the world, including countries that may not have the same privacy and security laws as yours. Regardless of the country in which such information is stored, we will process your Personal Information in accordance with this Policy.<br />16. User Rights<br />You have specific rights regarding the personal information we hold about you. These include the right to access, correct, and request the deletion of your personal information. If you wish to exercise any of these rights, please contact us directly at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="b2d3d6dfdbdcf2c5d7deded9d3c1d39cd1dddf">[email&#160;protected]</a>.
