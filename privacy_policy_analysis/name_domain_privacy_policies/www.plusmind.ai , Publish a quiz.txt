                    <li>Your Communications with Us. We may collect personal information, such as email address, phone number, or mailing address when you request information about our Services, register for our newsletter or marketing, request customer or technical support, apply for a job or otherwise communicate with us.</li>
                    <li>Surveys. We may contact you to participate in surveys. If you decide to participate, you may be asked to provide certain information which may include personal information.</li>
                    <li>Interactive Features. We and others who use our Services may collect personal information that you submit or make available through our interactive features (e.g., collaboration tools, messaging and chat features, commenting functionalities, forums, blogs, and social media pages). Any information you provide on the public sections of these features will be considered &quot;public,&quot;unless otherwise required by applicable law, and is not subject to the privacy protections referenced herein.</li>
                    <li>Business Development and Strategic Partnerships. We may collect personal information from individuals and third parties to assess and pursue potential business opportunities.</li>
                    <li>Job Applications. We may post job openings and opportunities on our Services. If you reply to one of these postings by submitting your application, CV and/or cover letter to us, we will collect and use your information to assess your qualifications.</li>
                    <li>Information Automatically Collected. We may collect certain information automatically when you use our Services, such as your Internet protocol (IP) address, user settings, MAC address, cookie identifiers, mobile carrier, mobile advertising and other unique identifiers, browser or device information, location information (including approximate location derived from IP address), and Internet service provider. We may also automatically collect information regarding your use of our Services, such as pages that you visit before, during and after using our Services, information about the links you click, the types of content you interact with, the frequency and duration of your activities, and other information about how you use our Services. In addition, we may collect information that other people provide about you when they use our Services, including information about you when they tag you.</li>
                    <li>Web log data. When you use the Site, we automatically receive and record certain information from your computer (or other device) and your browser. This may include such data as your IP address and domain name, the pages you visit on the Site, the date and time of your visit, the files that you download, the URLs from the websites you visit before and after navigating to the Site, your software and hardware attributes (including device IDs), your general geographic location (e.g., your city, state, or metropolitan region), and certain cookie information (see below). To obtain such information, we may use web logs or applications that recognize your computer and gather information about its online activity.</li>
                    <li>Cookies. We also use cookies on the Site. Cookies are small files that are stored on your computer by your web browser. A cookie allows the Site to recognize whether you have visited before and may store user preferences and other information. For example, cookies can be used to collect or store information about your use of the Site during your current session and over time (including the pages you view and the files you download), your computerâ€™s operating system and browser type, your Internet service provider, your domain name and IP address, your general geographic location, the website that you visited before the Site, and the link you used to leave the Site. If you are concerned about having cookies on your computer, you can set your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being set, allowing you to decide whether to accept it. You can also delete cookies from your computer. However, if you choose to block or delete cookies, certain features of the Site may not operate correctly.</li>
                    <li>Web beacons. The Site or the emails that you receive from EduCreator may use an application known as a &quot;web beacon &quot;(also known as a &quot;clear gif &quot;or &quot;web bug &quot;). A web beacon is an electronic file that usually consists of a single-pixel image. It can be embedded in a web page or in an email to transmit information, which could include personal information. For example, it can allow an email sender to determine whether a user has opened a particular email.</li>
                    <li>SDKs and mobile advertising IDs. Our Site may include third-party software development kits (&quot;SDKs &quot;) that allow us and our service providers to collect information about your activity. In addition, some mobile devices come with a resettable advertising ID (such as Apple's IDFA and Google's Advertising ID) that, like cookies and pixel tags, allow us and our service providers to identify your mobile device over time for advertising purposes.</li>
                    <li>Third-party plugins. Our Site may include plugins from other companies, including social media companies. These plugins may collect information, such as information about the pages you visit, and share it with the company that created the plugin even if you do not click on the plugin. These third-party plugins are governed by the privacy policies and terms of the companies that created them.</li>
                    <li>Third-party online tracking. We also may partner with certain third parties to collect, analyze, and use some of the personal and other information described in this section. For example, we may allow third parties to set cookies or use web beacons on the Site or in email communications from us. This information may be used for a variety of purposes, including online website analytics.</li>
                    <li>Aggregated and deidentified information. From time to time, we may also collect and share aggregated or deidentified information about Site users, such as by publishing a report on trends in the usage of the Site. Such aggregated or deidentified information will not identify you personally.
