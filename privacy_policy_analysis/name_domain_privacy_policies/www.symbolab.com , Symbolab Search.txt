<em>Advertising</em>
</h5>
<p>
We may serve ads on our Services or on external services
and engage and work with Service Providers and other third parties to serve advertisements on the Services
and/or on Third-Party Services. Some of these ads may be tailored to your interests based on your browsing,
across time, of the Services and elsewhere on the Internet, which may include use of data from cross-device
usage, sometimes referred to as "interest-based advertising" and "online behavioral
advertising" ("Interest-based Advertising"), which may include sending you an ad on a
third-party service after you have left the Services (i.e., "retargeting"). Our advertisers'
and ad networks' use of Tracking Technologies are governed by their own privacy policies
</p>
<h5 id="part-one-your-cookies-and-tracking-technologies-choices">
<em>Your Cookies and Tracking Technologies Choices</em>
</h5>
<p>
We may use Tracking Technologies to collect information
about interactions with the Services, including information about your browsing and purchasing behavior.
Tracking Technologies make Web-surfing and browsing easier for you by saving your preferences so that we can use
the saved information to facilitate and improve your use of the Services.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Regular cookies may generally be disabled or
removed by tools available as part of most commercial browsers, and in some instances blocked in the
future by selecting certain settings. Browsers offer different functionalities and options so you may
need to set them separately. Also, tools from commercial browsers may not be effective with regard to
some Tracking Technologies, such as HTML5 cookies. Please be aware that if you disable or remove these
technologies, some parts of the Services may not work and that when you revisit the Services your
ability to limit browser-based Tracking Technologies is subject to your browser settings and
limitations.
</li>
<li>
Some App-related Tracking Technologies in
connection with non-browser usage (e.g., most functionality of a mobile app) can only be disabled by
uninstalling the app. To uninstall an app, follow the instructions from your operating system or handset
manufacturer. Apple and Google mobile device settings have settings to limit ad tracking, and other
tracking, but these may not be completely effective.
</li>
<li>
Your browser settings may allow you to
automatically transmit a "Do Not Track" signal to online services you visit. Note, however,
there is no consensus among industry participants as to what "Do Not Track" means in this
context. Like many online services, we currently do not alter our practices when we receive a "Do
Not Track" signal from a visitor's browser. To find out more about "Do Not
Track," you can visit <a href="http://www.allaboutdnt.com/">http://www.allaboutdnt.com</a>, but we
are not responsible for the completeness or accuracy of this third-party information. You have the right
to request information from us about the Services that currently do not respond to "do not
track" mechanisms featured in any Internet browser by contacting us according to the "How to
Contact Us" section below.
</li>
<li>
Many advertisers and service providers that
perform advertising-related services for us and third parties participate in voluntary programs that
provide tools to opt-out of such interest-based advertising such as the Digital Advertising
Alliance's ("DAA") Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. To learn
more about how you can exercise certain choices regarding interest-based advertising for DAA members,
visit
<a href="https://youradchoices.com/"> https://youradchoices.com/</a>,
and <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices"> http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices</a>
for information on the DAA's opt-out program for mobile apps. Some
of these companies also are members of the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI"). To learn
more about the NAI and your opt-out options for their members, see
<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/"> http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/</a>
. You can also go to<a href="https://help.adroll.com/hc/en-us/requests/new"> https://help.adroll.com/hc/en-us/requests/new</a>
to adjust your advertising preferences with our service provider,
NextRoll, Inc. (which used to be called AdRoll), or here to opt out of the use of your data by one of
our other service providers, LiveRamp.
</li>
<li>
Please be aware that, even if you are able to opt
out of certain kinds of Interest-based Advertising, you may continue to receive other types of ads.
Opting out only means that those selected, participating members should no longer deliver certain
interest-based advertising to you but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content
and/or ads (e.g., from other ad networks). Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when
you visit these opt-out webpages, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different device or web
browser or use a non-browser-based method of access (e.g., mobile app), your browser-based opt-out may
not, or may no longer, be effective.

<li>
We support the ad industry's 2009
Self-regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising (<a href="https://www.iab.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ven-principles-07-01-09.pdf">
https://www.iab.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ven-principles-07-01-09.pdf</a>
) and expect that ad networks that we directly engage to serve you
interest-based advertising will do so as well, though we cannot guarantee their compliance. We are not
responsible for the effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-parties' opt-out options or
programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs.
</li>
<li>
In addition, we may serve ads on third-party
services that are targeted to reach people on those services that are also identified on one or more of
our databases ("Matched List Ads"). This is done by using Tracking Technologies, or by
matching common factors between our databases and the databases of the third-party services. We are not
responsible for these third-party services, including without limitation their security of the data. We
are not responsible for such third parties' failure to comply with your or our opt-out
instructions as they may not give us notice of opt-outs to our ads that you give to them, and they may
change their options without notice to us or you. For more information, please see the selling and
sharing sections of the applicable State-Specific Rights section.

If you are located in the EEA, UK or Canada, you
can manage your Cookies consent choices using our consent management platform provided by our service

<h4>
Cross Border Transfers of Personal Data
</h4>
<p>
Learneo businesses are located in the United States, Israel, India, The
Netherlands, and Canada and may continue to grow in other countries. We also have service providers both in the
United States and throughout the world. As such, Learneo and our service providers may transfer your personal data
to, or access it in, jurisdictions that may not provide equivalent levels of data protection as your home
jurisdiction. These transfers are necessary in order for us to provide our Services. When we transfer information
about individuals based in the EEA or UK outside of those countries, we will take appropriate measures to safeguard
the transfer as required by applicable law, including:
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Adequacy Decisions</strong>: European Commission decisions recognizing
that certain countries and territories outside of the EEA ensure an adequate level of protection for personal data.
Depending on your use of our Services, when we transfer your personal data from the EEA to Israel or the UK, we rely
on the European Commission's adequacy decision for Israel and the UK. Further, where we transfer your personal data
from the EEA to an US recipient participating in the DPF (including the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy
Framework (DPF), where applicable), we rely on the European Commission's adequacy decision for the US.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Standard Contractual Clauses</strong>: Transfers to countries that don't have an adequacy decision typically take place on the basis of the European Commission-approved standard contractual data protection clauses (together with the UK Annex
for transfers from the UK), which we use for transfers to countries including but not limited to the US (where the
recipient does not participate in the DPF), and Singapore.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
In certain circumstances, cross border transfers may take place on the basis of exemptions provided for under
applicable data protection law.
</p>
<p>
You may always contact us to request a copy of the transfer measures that we have taken to safeguard the transfer of
your personal data.
</p>
<h5>
Complaints
</h5>
<p>
You have the right to lodge a complaint about our practices with respect to your personal data before a supervisory data
protection authority.

law or otherwise specified in this privacy policy, we will destroy or de-identify any record of your government ID

complaint. If an investigation has been opened following a complaint made by you, we will contact you with the
result of that complaint as soon as possible.
</p>

<em>
Transfers of Personal Data Outside Australia

service-providers and other third parties that require such information to assist us in providing Services to you.
Your personal data may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than Australia, including United States,
Israel, India, The Netherlands, and Canada or other countries as might be the case in the future. We will only
transfer your personal data overseas for the same purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. Personal data that is
stored overseas may not be subject to the APA or the APPs. However, we will not transfer or permit any of your
personal data to be transferred outside of Australia unless we have taken reasonable steps to ensure the transfer is
in compliance with applicable laws, and in any case to a recipient that has privacy protections in place which are
at least substantially similar to which the APPs protect information.

<em>
Consequences If We Can't Collect Your Personal Data

When you Apply to be a Tutor on Course Hero
</h4>
<p>
If you apply to be a tutor, using the information above we
will verify your identity as part of your tutor application review. We may also verify your identity when
you withdraw funds from your tutor account or to protect your account when we detect fraudulent activity. To
verify your identity, we will collect your mobile phone number for SMS verification, an image of your photo ID
(such as your driver's license or other government ID; excluding passport), as well as a photo of
yourself. If your professional license is issued by a government, and/or you provide a government-issued
professional license card, we will verify the authenticity of that information with the relevant government.
We may use a third-party identification service provider to collect this personal information to perform
this identity verification on our behalf. When we do, we will inform you about the service provider we use
and the process for verifying your identity with them. Any of the identification service providers we use
will only process your personal information at our instruction and for the purposes of verifying your identity
on Course Hero. In those cases, we will only collect and use the personal information you provide for
identification verification with your consent that you provide at the time we collect this information.
You can revoke this consent at any time by emailing

Data Retention
</h2>
<p>
Except as otherwise permitted or required by applicable
law or regulation, we retain personal information about you for as long as you have an open account with us, as
long as necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for.
In some cases, we retain personal
information for longer and for other legitimate purposes, including if doing so is necessary to comply with our
legal obligations, enforcing and preventing violations of our Terms, to fight spam, protecting or defending our
rights, property and users, to resolve disputes or collect fees owed, or is otherwise permitted or required by
applicable law, rule or regulation. We may further retain information in an anonymous or aggregated form, where
that information would not identify you personally. Applicable storage periods are determined on a case-by-case
basis.
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider applicable
legal requirements, the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm
from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes we process your personal
information for, and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means. We will maintain certain types
of personal information for a limited duration.
For example, we keep account information, like your name,
email address, and password, for as long as your account is in existence because we need it to operate your
account.

Personal Data Collected
</h2>
<h3>
<em>When you sign up with QuillBot</em>
</h3>
<p>
When you register for an account to use our Services, we
ask you for your name and email. If you sign up for our premium Services, payment information, such as card
number, is collected and processed directly by our third-party payment processors. Our payment processors
are <strong>Amazon Pay, Stripe, PayPal, Chargebee, Razorpay, Google
Pay and Apple Pay</strong>. For information on our payment
processor's collection, use and storage of your personal data, please see the payment processor's
privacy policy. Our payment processors do not share your full payment card information with us. Our
payment processors may share limited payment data with us, including card type, last 4 digits of card, token
number, expiration date, and country or PayPal email subject to restrictions in the applicable law in your
jurisdiction.
</p>
<h3>
<em>Collected through your use of QuillBot</em>
</h3>
<p>
When you use our Services, we collect the following information:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Usage information (such as the date and time of visits, pages viewed, links to/from any page, and time spent in a session)
</li>
<li>
Device information (such as your internet protocol
(IP) address, Internet service provider, operating system, computer model, language settings and CPU
details, and web browser type)
</li>
<li>
Inference Information about your usage of
QuillBot, such as whether you are a frequent document uploader or user of a particular feature.
</li>
<li>
Location information (approximated, based on your
IP address), to identify the applicable regional subscription offering and to detect/identify fraud on
our Services
</li>
</ul>
<p>
We may also collect personal data you provide or otherwise make available to us when you use our Services. For example:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
When you use the Plagiarism Checker, we store a
copy of your document, which includes any information contained within.
</li>
<li>
When you use our Paraphraser tool, we will collect
any information you paraphrase, including personal data you enter into Paraphraser.
</li>
<li>
When you upload documents to our Services, we will
store both a copy of the original document (or the text of the original document) as well as the
paraphrased version and any information contained within.
</li>
<li>
When you use QuillBot Flow, we will collect any information, including personal data, you enter into your project(s)
within the editor.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
If you use the voice recognition feature on QuillBot Flow for audio to text conversion, the audio to text conversion
occurs in real time and audio is not stored by us; however, the text converted from audio input that is added by you to
your project(s) is stored by us in accordance with this policy.
</p>
<h3>
<em>Collected when you use QuillBot's Browser Extensions</em>
</h3>
<p>
When you use QuillBot's browser extensions, the
contents in the email you prepare and receive, chat messages you write (excluding history or chats received),
documents you create, search queries, and text you input on multiline fields on websites you visit ("Your
Content"), as transmitted by you in connection with your use of our extension, will be used in real time
on our machine learning algorithm to generate outputs, after which Your Content is deleted from our Services. We
only store Your Content after you provide your consent, which you can revoke at any time within the
extension icon found on the right top corner of your browser.
</p>
<p>
When you use QuillBot's Chrome extension, we will
store your Command Data, which includes the text and metadata (including any personal data as described in this
Privacy Policy) of any command that you provide to QuillBot to perform a specific function. For example, when
you provide the command "Write an email for a business proposal," we will store that text and the
metadata associated with it, including your personal data like your QuillBot account and browser information. We
use the Command Data we store to understand usage, optimize our Services, and provide the best experience on
QuillBot.
</p>
<p>
Command Data is distinct from Your Content, which includes
the contents of the email you prepare and receive, chat messages you write (excluding history or chats
received), documents you create, search queries, and text you enter in multiline fields on websites you visit.
We process Command Data in real time using our machine learning algorithm to generate outputs. After this
real-time processing, Your Content is deleted from our Services.
</p>
<p>
We also collect URLs and usage information (in addition to
the usage information described above), such as the number of times you disable/enable the extension on a
website. This information helps us understand how you use this service and how we can improve it.
</p>
<p>
We do not access your contacts, text in single-line fields
(which are more likely to contain personal data), or content in fields marked "sensitive," such as
credit card, password, email address, or email subject fields.
</p>
<p>
We only collect Your Content when the QuillBot icon is
displayed and enabled, indicating that Your Content will be grammar-checked or paraphrased. We only store Your
Content with your consent. You can disable the extension or revoke consent at any time by clicking the QuillBot
icon in the top-right corner of your browser and going to "Preferences."
</p>
<p>
We also collect URLs and usage information when you use
QuillBot on a website (in addition to the usage information described immediately above), such as the number of
times you disable/enable the extension on a website, which we retain to help us understand how you use this
Service and to help us improve it. We only collect Your Content when the QuillBot icon is displayed and enabled,
indicating that Your Content will be grammar checked or paraphrased. You can choose to disable the QuillBot
extension at any time on the top right corner of your browser. We do not access your contacts, text in
single-line input fields (which are more likely to contain personal data), or content in fields marked
"sensitive" such as credit card, password, email address or email subject fields.
</p>
<h3>
<em>Collected when you use the QuillBot Desktop App</em>
</h3>
<p>
When you install the QuillBot desktop app, QuillBot will
request permission to access your computer's accessibility features. This allows us to collect your
inputs from within certain applications on your computer to enable us to provide our Services to you. Your
inputs will be used in real time on our machine learning algorithm to generate outputs, after which they are
deleted. Access to your accessibility features also allow us to identify apps you use but which are yet to be
supported, so we can display a feedback widget. After you grant permissions to your computer's
accessibility settings, you can choose when to use the QuillBot desktop app to help improve your writing at any
time, by clicking on the QuillBot icon that appears when you open certain compatible apps on your computer.
</p>
<h3>
<em>Collected about you when you participate in QuillBot University</em>
</h3>
<p>
If you choose to sign up for a QuillBot University event (including live webinars), we will collect your first and last
name, email address, occupation, country of residence, and any other personal data you provide to us. We may use this
personal data in order to process your registration, provide you with the event, and to improve our future events and
our services.
</p>
<h3>
<em>Collected about you from third party sources</em>
</h3>
<p>
If you choose to sign up with QuillBot using certain
third-party log-in services (such as Facebook or Google) you will provide us or allow the log-in service to
provide us with your personal data, such as your email, name and/or username, if available, and any other
personal data specified by that third-party log-in service. For more information about the personal data shared
with QuillBot, please see the third-party log-in service's (Facebook or Google) privacy policies.
</p>
<p>In some cases, we may receive information about your
interactions with products and services offered by our affiliates for which we provide technical or other
services. We may also collect personal data about you from a third party, such as your employer or
academic institution, to enable your account setup to use our Services. We will also receive limited payment
information from our payment service providers (as described above), which we need to manage your QuillBot
subscription.
</p>
<p>We may collect the first and last name of any
author's work available in the Creative Commons for the purposes of establishing correct authorship
attribution and creating author profiles on QuillBot.
</p>
<p>
We use analytics services such as Google Analytics and
Amplitude to collect and process certain analytics data when you use our Services. These services may also
collect information about your use of other websites, apps, and online resources. For more information about our
use of these services, please see our
<a href="https://quillbot.com/cookie-policy">

experience and improve our Services.
</p>
<p>
We collect your email and any other personal data you may
provide to us when you choose to respond to surveys or questionnaires we send for research purposes or as part
of our Services; or when you choose to provide feedback.
</p>
<p>
If you choose to connect to QuillBot using your Google account, you may also use the Upload from Drive feature on
QuillBot Flow to connect your Google Drive account to QuillBot. You may then select which of your Google Drive files you wish to import, and use our
Services to edit your document(s). You may only use the Upload from Drive feature after you grant QuillBot
permission to "see and download" all of the files in your Google Drive account. QuillBot will
collect and store the information contained in any Google Drive document you import as described in this policy.
Quillbot's use and transfer to any other app of information received from Google APIs will adhere to the

When you sign up for QuillBot's premium Services
under a Team Plan, we collect personal data from Team Plan Owners, Administrators, and Writers (as defined in
our Terms of Service) necessary to administer and operate the Services.
</p>
<p>
If you are a Team Plan Owner, we collect your first and
last name and email address. You also have the option to provide us with your phone number, company name,
Business Tax Identifier, and address. As Team Plan Owner, you may invite other individuals to join the
Team Plan as either an Administrator or Writer. In such a case, we use your name on the email invitation to
Writers and Administrators added by you. Payment information, such as card number, is collected and
processed directly by our third-party payment processors. Our payment processors do not share your full payment
card information with us.
</p>
<p>
If you are a Writer or Administrator, we collect your
email address from the Team Plan Owner to send you an invitation to join the Team Plan. To join a Team
Plan, you will need to register an account with QuillBot. When you register an account, we will collect
additional personal data as described in the "Collected When you sign up with QuillBot" section of
this policy.

Deleting Your Scribbr Account
</h2>
<p>
If you would like to delete your account from the Scribbr
platform, you can do this directly by going to "Account" in "Settings." If you choose to
delete your account: 1) your account information (first and last name, email address, phone number, user type,
and any other information you provided on your account) will be deleted from the Scribbr platform, 2) all your
uploaded documents and order details will be deleted automatically; this is irrevocable, and you can never use
or enter this account again; 3) the Scribbr team will no longer have access to your documents. This means we
cannot deal with possible complaints, as we cannot address complaints from deleted accounts.
</p>
<p>
If the GDPR, US State privacy laws, or other privacy law
grants you the right to have your personal data deleted entirely from Scribbr and you want to exercise that
right, please read Part One of this policy for how to submit your request.
