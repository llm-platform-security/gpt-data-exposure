        "The chart below has examples of how various Firebase services use and handle\nend-user data that may potentially be identifying.",
        "Firebase service | End-user data | How data helps provide the service  \n---|---|---  \nCloud Functions for Firebase | \n\n  * IP addresses\n\n|  **How it helps:** Cloud Functions uses IP addresses to execute event-\nhandling functions and HTTP functions based on end-user actions.",
        "Firebase Authentication | \n\n  * Passwords\n  * Email addresses\n  * Phone numbers\n  * User agents\n  * IP addresses\n\n|  **How it helps:** Firebase Authentication uses the data to enable end-user\nauthentication, and facilitate end-user account management.",
        "It also uses user-\nagent strings and IP addresses to provide added security and prevent abuse\nduring sign-up and authentication.",
        "Firebase App Check | \n\n  * Attestation material from supported attestation providers\n  * App Check tokens from successful attestations\n\n|  **How it helps:** Firebase App Check uses attestation material required by\nthe corresponding attestation provider and received from end-user's devices to\nhelp establish the integrity of the device and/or the app.",
        "For\ndevelopers who use replay protection features, App Check stores the App Check\ntokens used with these features for at most 30 days.",
        "Firebase App Distribution | \n\n  * Users' names\n  * Email addresses\n  * iOS UDIDs\n  * [Secure Android IDs](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/Settings.Secure.html#ANDROID_ID)\n  * Firebase installation IDs\n  * Tester feedback (screenshots and text)\n\n|  **How it helps:** Firebase App Distribution uses the data to distribute app\nbuilds to testers, monitor tester activity, enable tester features like in-app\nfeedback, and associate data with tester devices.",
        "Firebase Cloud Messaging | \n\n  * Firebase installation IDs\n\n|  **How it helps:** Firebase Cloud Messaging uses Firebase installation IDs\nto determine which devices to deliver messages to.",
        "Firebase Crashlytics | \n\n  * Crashlytics Installation UUIDs\n  * Firebase installations ID\n  * Crash traces\n  * Breakpad minidump formatted data  \n_(NDK crashes only)_\n\n|  **How it helps:** Firebase Crashlytics uses crash stack traces to associate\ncrashes with a project, send email alerts to project members and display them\nin the Firebase Console, and help Firebase customers debug crashes.",
        "It uses\nCrashlytics Installation UUIDs to measure the number of users impacted by a\ncrash and minidump data to process NDK crashes.",
        "Refer to [ Examples of stored device\ninformation](https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy#crash-stored-info)\nfor more detail on the types of user information gathered.",
        "**Note:** Firebase Crashlytics stores minidump data\nonly temporarily in order to process NDK crashes.",
        "Firebase Dynamic Links | \n\n  * Device specs (iOS)\n  * IP Addresses (iOS)\n\n|  **How it helps:** Dynamic Links uses device specs and IP addresses on iOS\nto open newly-installed apps to a specific page or context.",
        "**Retention:**\nDynamic Links only stores device specs and IP addresses temporarily, to\nprovide the service.",
        "Firebase Hosting | \n\n  * IP addresses\n\n|  **How it helps:** Hosting uses IP addresses of incoming requests to detect\nabuse and provide customers with detailed analysis of usage data.",
        "Firebase Performance Monitoring | \n\n  * Firebase installation IDs\n  * IP addresses\n\n|  **How it helps:** Performance Monitoring uses Firebase installation IDs to\ncalculate the number of unique Firebase installations that access network\nresources, to ensure that access patterns are sufficiently anonymous.",
        "Additionally, it uses IP addresses to map\nperformance events to the countries they originate from.",
        "For more information,\nsee [Data collection](/support/privacy#performance-monitoring-collected-info).",
        "Firebase In-App Messaging | \n\n  * Firebase installation IDs\n\n|  **How it helps:** Firebase In-App Messaging uses Firebase installation IDs\nto determine which devices to deliver messages to.",
        "Firebase Realtime Database | \n\n  * IP addresses\n  * User agents\n\n|  **How it helps:** Realtime Database uses IP addresses and user agents to\nenable the [profiler\ntool](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/usage/profile), which helps\nFirebase customers understand usage trends and platform breakdowns.",
        "**Retention:** Realtime Database keeps IP addresses and user agent information\nfor a few days, unless a customer chooses to save it for longer.",
        "Firebase Remote Config | \n\n  * Firebase installation IDs\n\n|  **How it helps:** Remote Config uses Firebase installation IDs to select\nconfiguration values to return to end-user devices.",

        "If you're a customer who would like to offer users a chance to opt-in to a\nservice, and the data collection that comes with it, in most cases that just\nrequires adding a dialog or settings toggle before using the service.",
